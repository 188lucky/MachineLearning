gene Map Locus one three q two two q three two is associated with a constellation of disorders a pleiotropic syndrome including ic and other bladder and kidney problems thyroid diseases serious headaches migraines panic disorder and mitral valve prolapse symptoms it may well be that the symptoms of interstitial cystitis have multiple causes and ic is actually several syndromes which will eventually be discerned for example patients with hunner s ulcers are believed to be the most advanced cases they have larger wounds in the bladder that are much more difficult to treat it is estimated that only five to one zero of patients have these ulcers far more patients may experience a very mild form of ic in which they have no visible wounds in their bladder yet struggle with symptoms of frequency urgency and or pain still other patients may have discomfort only in their urethra while others struggle with pain in the entire pelvis some patients may experience pelvic floor tightness and dysfunction while others have normal muscle tone often the symptoms of ic are misdiagnosed as a common bladder infection cystitis however unlike cystitis ic has not been conclusively proven to be a bacterial infection and the mis prescribed treatment of antibiotics is ineffective the symptoms of ic may also initially be attributed to prostatitis and epididymitis in men and endometriosis and uterine fibroids in women diagnosis diagnosis has been greatly simplied in recent years with the development of two new methodologies the pelvic pain urgency frequency puf patient survey created by c lowell parsons is a short questionnaire that will help doctors identify if pelvic pain could be coming from the bladder the kcl test aka the potassium sensitivity test uses a mild potassium solution to test the integrity of the bladder wall though the latter is not specific for ic it has been determined to be helpful in predicting the use of compounds such as pentosan which are designed to help repair the gag layer the previous gold standard test for ic was the use of hydrodistention with cystoscopy researchers however determined that this visual examination of the bladder wall after stretching the bladder was also not specific for ic and that the test itself can contribute to the development of small glomerulations aka petechial hemorrhages often found in ic thus a diagnosis of ic is one of exclusion as well as a review of clinical symptoms treatment diet the foundation of therapy is a modification of diet to help patients avoid those foods which can will further irritate the damaged bladder wall common offenders include coffees teas herbal teas green teas all sodas particularly diet concentrated fruit juices multivitamins monosodium glutamate chocolate and potassium rich foods such as bananas patients who continue to consume daily coffee are those which appear to struggle the most with symptoms particularly pain most ic support groups and many urology clinics have diet lists available the problem with diet triggers is that they vary from person to person the best way for a person to discover his or her own triggers is to use an elimination diet this is where someone cuts out all foods except the basics e g potatoes bread rice water and then introduces new foods one at a time trying to discover which foods are one s own triggers without the use of an elimination diet is like trying to do a scientific experiment whilst altering one zero variables all at once bladder coatings as recently as a decade ago treatments available were limited to the use of astringent instillations such as clorpactin or silver nitrate designed to kill infection and or strip off the bladder lining in two zero zero five our understanding of ic has improved dramatically and these therapies are now no longer done rather ic therapy is typically multi modal including the use of a bladder coating an antihistamine to help control mast cell activity and a low dose antidepressant to fight neuroinflammation the two us fda approved therapies for ic have had recent setbacks in various research studies oral elmiron aka pentosan polysulfate is believed to provide a protective coating in the bladder however data released in late two zero zero five by alza pharmaceuticals suggests that eight four of elmiron is eliminated intact in feces another six is excreted via urine reference metabolism of three hpentosan polysulfate sodium pps in healthy human volunteers xenobiotica two zero zero five aug three five eight seven seven five eight four in addition the nih funded icctg study of pentosan revealed results only slightly better than placebo dmso a wood pulp extract is the only approved bladder instillation for ic yet it is much less frequently used in urology clinics research studies presented at recent conferences of the american urological association by c subah packer have demonstrated that the fda approved dosage of a five zero solution of dmso had the potential of creating irreversible muscle contraction however a lesser solution of two five was found to be reversible long term use is questionable at best particularly given the fact that the method of action of dmso is not fully understood more recently the use of a rescue instillation composed of elmiron or heparin cystistat lidocaine and sodium bicarbonate has generated considerable excitement in the ic community because it is the first therapeutic intervention that can be used to reduce a flare of symptoms published studies report a nine zero effectiveness in reducing symptoms another bladder coating treatment is that of cystistat tm which consists primarily of sodium hyaluronate it is believed to replace the deficient gag layer on the bladder wall like most other intravesical bladder treatments this treatment requires the patient to lie for two zero four zero minutes turning over every ten minutes to allow the chemical to soak in and give a good coating before it is passed out with the urine pelvic floor treatments pelvic floor dysfunction may also be a contributing factor thus most major ic clinics now evaluate the pelvic floor and or refer patients directly to a physical therapist for a prompt treatment of pelvic floor muscle tension or weakness pain control pain control is usually necessary in the ic treatment plan the pain of ic has been rated equivalent to cancer pain and should not be ignored to avoid central sensitization the use of a variety of traditional pain medications including opiates is often necessary to treat the varying degrees of pain complementary therapies such as acupuncture massage and biofeedback are also beneficial to some patients even children with ic should be appropriately addressed regarding pelvic pain and receive necessary treatment to manage it electronic pain killing options include tens a machine connected to sticky pads which one palces on their body at certain pressure points the tens machine sends electrical impulses to the skin using the human body as an earth ptns stimulators have also been used with varying degrees of success this is similar to a tens treatment except a needle is used rather than sticky pads other treatments bladder distentions a procedure which stretches the bladder capacity done under general anaesthetic have shown remarkable success in giving pain relief to patients however many experts still cannot understand precisely how this can cause pain relief unfortunately the relief achieved by bladder distentions is only temporary weeks or months and consequently it is not really viable as a long term treatment for interstitial cystitis it is generally only used in extreme cases surgical interventions are rarely used for ic neurostimulation techniques are not fda approved for ic links to other conditions it is important to note that some people with ic also develop other medical conditions such as anxiety disorder usually because of the nature of the symptoms and other conditions that may have the same etiology as ic these include irritable bowel syndrome ibs

which defendants may argue that they should not be held criminally liable for breaking the law as they were mentally ill or mentally incompetent at the time of their allegedly criminal actions the insanity defense is still in use in the united states while most commonwealth countries have moved to a mental disorder defence the insanity defense is available in most jurisdictions that respect human rights and have a rule of law though the extent to which it can or should be applied may differ widely between jurisdictions e g as in cases involving the battered woman syndrome where self defense is not available a defendant may be forced to choose between an insanity defense and provocation this defense is based on a principle that punishment is only reasonable if the defendant is capable of distinguishing right and wrong a defendant making this argument might be said to be pleading not guilty by reason of insanity ngri psychiatric treatment those found to have been not guilty by reason of insanity are generally then required to undergo psychiatric treatment except in the case of temporary insanity see below defendants found not guilty by reason of insanity are generally placed in a mental institution unlike defendants who are found guilty of a crime they are not institutionalized for a fixed period but rather they are held within the institution until authorities determine that they are no longer a threat authorities making this decision tend to be cautious as a result defendants can often spend more time there than they would have in prison had they been convicted in foucha v louisiana one nine nine two the supreme court ruled that a person could not be held indefinitely psychosis and schizophrenia in practice a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity almost always requires that the defendant have been in a state of active psychosis at the time the law was broken and usually such findings involve a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia the use of the insanity defense in cases of psychopathy is rare and almost uniformly unsuccessful incompetency intoxication and mental illness the concept of insanity is different from the concept of incompetency incompetency denotes the inability of a defendant to understand the charges against them and to participate in their defense and relates to the defendant s state of mind at the time of trial a trial cannot proceed if a defendant has been found incompetent unless the defendant later becomes competent in the united states a trial in which the insanity defense is invoked typically involves the testimony of psychiatrists who will argue that the defendant is or is not insane if there is agreement between the prosecution and defense that the defendant is insane then typically a jury trial is waived and a trial occurs in front of a judge in which evidence is presented and a judgment rendered if there is disagreement between the prosecution and defense each will typically present expert witnesses to a jury which will decide whose witnesses to believe the legal concept of insanity is different from the psychiatric concept of mental illness frequently a person whose mental illness is not under dispute will be determined sane as the court will argue that despite a mental illness the defendant should still be held responsible such a ruling is known as either a guilty but mentally ill gbmi or a guilty but insane verdict michigan one nine seven five was the first state to pass a gbmi verdict sometimes a person without mental illness can be found to be insane for example a person who is acting under the influence of a drug that was involuntarily administered though voluntary intoxication has been rejected by most jurisdictions as a defence to crime see involuntary intoxication history of the insanity defense the concept of defense by insanity has existed since ancient greece and rome the first complete transcript of an insanity trial dates one seven two four edward ii under english common law declared that a person was insane if their mental capacity was no more than that of a wild beast however in the united states the pioneer in the insanity defense could be credited to new hampshire chief justice charles cogswell doe in ford v wainwright one nine seven five the us supreme court ruled that insane prisoners cannot be executed the insanity plea was legalized in the united states with the m naghten rules which came as a direct result of the attempted assassination of british prime minister robert peel in one eight four three the insanity plea can be used if at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense the defendant as a result of a severe mental disease or defect was unable to appreciate the nature and quality of the wrongfulness of his acts the key is that the defendant could not appreciate the nature of his actions during the commission of the crime not before or after one novel use of the insanity defense occurred in the case of lee boyd malvo who plead not guilty by reason of insanity in the beltway sniper shootings many legal experts believe that the purpose of raising the defense was not to gain an acquittal but to allow the defense to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence about malvo s upbringing his relationship with john allen muhammad and his mental state this evidence was intended to gain the jury s sympathy so that they would not invoke the death penalty and was successful at doing so controversy over the insanity defense there are many different interpretations of insane and many different notions of how to deal with insane individuals in the us one nine eight two the insanity defense came under increasing criticism following the acquittal of john hinckley jr who attempted to assassinate president reagan critics of the defense argue that it relies too much on opinion and or permits behavior by one group which is forbidden to another if you commit a big crime then you are crazy and the more heinous the crime the crazier you must be therefore you are not responsible and nothing is your fault some opponents of the insanity defense including thomas szasz believe that psychiatry itself emerged as a way to justify mercy of making persons exceptional and thus not deserving of the harsh punishment we would as a society wish to dole out to people who had extremely selfish or widely shared rationales for their actions since extreme selfishness self absorption or broadly shared resentments e g envy of the rich hatred of another ethnic group are somewhat infectious behaviors some argue that schizophrenia and other mental illness were defined into existence to protect those whose motives and behaviors were not so infectious and whose offenses were thus unlikely to be repeated by others the cost of this system of mercy however was to classify the psychiatrist and patient in an ongoing unequal power relationship see myth of mental illness and antipsychiatry in ancient rome latin tribes held various religious beliefs that included considering the insane to be divinely blessed and therefore beyond the reach of human jurisdiction it is alleged that insanity as an excuse was introduced in the ancient roman legal system based upon this tradition some modern critics claim that this precedent precludes the insanity defense s validity in a modern secular state like the united states with a constitutional doctrine of separation of church and state the public tends to believe that the insanity defense is used more often than it actually is possibly because insanity defense cases tend to be of a high profile nature the insanity plea is used in the u s criminal justice system in less than one of all criminal cases and only one fourth of those defendants are found not guilty by reason of insanity six zero seven zero of all insanity pleas are not in murder cases some us courts have begun to ban the use of the insanity defense and a one nine nine four supreme court ruling upheld the right of montana to do so idaho and utah have also banned this defense rules of appreciation in this section various rules applied in united states jurisdiction with respect to insanity defenses are discussed the m naghten rules the m naghten rules one eight four three one zero c insane if at the time of the committing of the act the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason arising from a disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing or if he did know it that he did not know what he was doing was wrong these rules are as of two zero zero five in force in the majority of common law jurisdictions the irresistible impulse there is also an idea of an irresistible impulse which argues that a person may have known an act was illegal but because of a mental impairment they couldn t control their actions in one nine nine four lorena bobbitt was found not guilty of the felony of malicious wounding the equivalent of mayhem when her defense argued that an irresistible impulse led her to cut off her husband s penis in the late nineteenth century some states and federal courts in the united states dissatisfied with the m naghten rule adopted the irrestible impulse test this test which had first been used in ohio in one eight three four emphasized the inablility to control one s actions a person who committed a crime during an uncontrollable fit of passion was considered insane and not guility under this test the durham rule the durham rule or product test was set forth by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in one nine five four and states that an accused is not criminally responsible if her unlawful act was the product of mental disease or defect after the one nine seven zero s us jurisdictions have tended to not recognize this argument as it places emphasis on mental disease or defect and thus on testimony by psychiatrists and is argued to be somewhat ambiguous the insanity defense reform act us the insanity defense reform act enacted by congress in one nine eight four in response to the verdict in the hinckley trial and codified at title one eight u s code section one seven states that a person accused of a crime can be adjudged not guilty by reason of insanity if the defendant as a result of a severe mental disease or defect was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of her acts the substantial capacity test the substantial capacity test was defined by the american law institute in its model penal code this argues that insanity should be defined as a lack of substantial capacity to control one s behavior substantial capacity is defined as the mental capacity needed to understand the wrongfulness of an act or to conform behavior to the law this is related to the m naghten rule and the idea of irresistible impulse the brawner rule the brawner rule one nine seven two argues that insanity should be decided by a jury under this proposal juries are allowed to decide the insanity question as they see fit temporary insanity the notion of temporary insanity argues that a defendant was insane but is now sane a defendant found to have been temporarily insane will often be released without any requirements of psychiatric treatment this defense was first used by u s congressman daniel sickles of new york in one eight five nine after he had killed his wife s lover philip barton key but was most used during the one nine four zero s and one nine five zero s since then it has not been as successful scottish law the scottish law commission in its discussion paper no one two two on insanity and diminished responsibility two zero zero three pp one six one eight confirms that the law has not substantially changed from the position stated in hume s commentaries we may next attend to the case of those unfortunate persons who have plead the miserable defence of idiocy or insanity which condition if it is not an assumed or imperfect but a genuine and thorough insanity and is proved by the testimony of intelligent witnesses makes the act like that of an infant and equally bestows the privilege of an entire exemption from any manner of pain cum alterum innocentia concilii tuetur alterum fati infelicitas excusat i say where the insanity is absolute and is duly proved for if reason and humanity enforce the plea in these circumstances it is no less necessary to observe a caution and reserve in applying the law as shall hinder it from being understood that there is any privilege in a case of mere weakness of intellect or a strange and moody humour or a crazy and capricious or irritable temper in none of these situations does or can the law excuse the offender because such constitutions are not exclusive of a competent understanding of the true state of the circumstances in which the deed is done nor of the subsistence of some steady and evil passion grounded in those circumstances and directed to a certain object to serve the purpose of a defence in law the disorder must therefore amount to an absolute alienation of reason ut continua mentis alienatione omni intellectu careat such a disease as deprives the patient of the knowledge of the true aspect and position of things about him hinders him from distinguishing friend from foe

earth s climate resulting in an expansion of the continental ice sheets polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers glaciation glaciologically ice age is often used to mean a period of ice sheets in the northern and southern hemispheres by this definition we are still in an ice age because the greenland and antarctic ice sheets still exist more colloquially when speaking of the last few million years ice age is used to refer to colder periods with extensive ice sheets over the north american and european continents in this sense the last ice age ended about one zero zero zero zero years ago this article will use the term ice age in the former glaciological sense and use the term glacial periods for colder periods during ice ages and interglacial for the warmer periods during the last few million years there have been many glacial periods occurring initially at four zero zero zero zero year frequency but more recently at one zero zero zero zero zero year frequencies these are the best studied there have been four major ice ages in the further past origin of ice age theory the idea that in the past glaciers had been far more extensive was folk knowledge in some alpine regions of europe imbrie and imbrie p two five quote a woodcutter telling jean de charpentier of the former extent of the swiss grimsel glacier no single person invented the idea between one eight two five and one eight three three charpentier assembled evidence in support of this idea in one eight three six charpentier convinced louis agassiz of the theory and agassiz published it in his book tude sur les glaciers of one eight four zero at this early stage of knowledge what were being studied were the glacial periods within the past few hundred thousand years during the current ice age the far earlier ice ages very existence was unsuspected major ice ages there have been at least four major ice ages in the earth s past the earliest hypothesized ice age is believed to have occurred around two seven to two three billion one zero nine years ago during the early proterozoic age main article snowball earth the earliest well documented ice age and probably the most severe of the last one billion years occurred from eight zero zero to six zero zero million years ago the cryogenian period and it has been suggested that it produced a snowball earth in which permanent sea ice extended to or very near the equator it has been suggested that the end of this ice age was responsible for the subsequent cambrian explosion though this theory is recent and controversial a minor ice age occurred from four six zero to four three zero million years ago during the late ordovician period there were extensive polar ice caps at intervals from three five zero to two six zero million years ago during the carboniferous and early permian periods associated with the karoo ice age sediment records showing the fluctuating sequences of glacials and interglacials during the last several million years the present ice age began four zero million years ago with the growth of an ice sheet in antarctica but intensified during the pleistocene starting around three million years ago with the spread of ice sheets in the northern hemisphere since then the world has seen cycles of glaciation with ice sheets advancing and retreating on four zero zero zero zero and one zero zero zero zero zero year time scales the last glacial period ended about one zero zero zero zero years ago the timing of ice ages throughout geologic history is in part controlled by the position of the continental plates on the surface of the earth when landmasses are concentrated near the polar regions there is an increased chance for snow and ice to accumulate small changes in solar energy can tip the balance between summers in which the winter snow mass completely melts and summers in which the winter snow persists until the following winter due to the positions of greenland antarctica and the northern portions of europe asia and north america in polar regions the earth today is considered prone to ice age glaciations evidence for ice ages comes in various forms including rock scouring and scratching glacial moraines drumlins valley cutting and the deposition of till or tillites and glacial erratics successive glaciations tend to distort and erase the geological evidence making it difficult to interpret it took some time for the current theory to be worked out analyses of ice cores and ocean sediment cores unambiguously show the record of glacials and interglacials over the past few million years interglacials shows the pattern of temperature and ice volume changes associated with recent glacials and interglacials in between ice ages there are multi million year periods of more temperate almost tropical climate but also within the ice ages or at least within the last one temperate and severe periods occur the colder periods are called glacial periods the warmer periods interglacials such as the eemian interglacial era we are in an interglacial period now the last retreat ending about one zero zero zero zero years ago there appears to be a folk wisdom that the typical interglacial period lasts one two zero zero zero years but this is hard to substantiate from the evidence of ice core records for example an article in nature argues that the current interglacial might be most analogous to a previous interglacial that lasted two eight zero zero zero years nonetheless fear of a new glacial period starting soon does exist see global cooling however many now believe that anthropogenic manmade forcing from increased greenhouse gases would outweigh any milankovitch orbital forcing and some recent considerations of the orbital forcing have even argued that in the absence of human perturbations the present interglacial could potentially last five zero zero zero zero years causes of ice ages the cause of ice ages remains controversial for both the large scale ice age periods and the smaller ebb and flow of glacial interglacial periods within an ice age the general consensus is that it is a combination of up to three different factors atmospheric composition particularly the fraction of co two and methane changes in the earth s orbit around the sun known as milankovitch cycles and possibly the sun s orbit around the galaxy and the arrangement of the continents the first of these three factors is probably responsible for much of the change especially for the first ice age the snowball earth hypothesis maintains that the severe freezing in the late proterozoic was both caused and ended by changes in co two levels in the atmosphere however the other two factors do matter an abundance of land within the arctic and antarctic circles appears to be a necessity for an ice age probably because the landmasses provide space on which snow and ice can accumulate during cooler times and thus trigger positive feedback processes like albedo changes the earth s orbit does not have a great effect on the long term causation of ice ages but does seem to dictate the pattern of multiple freezings and thawings that take place within the current ice age the complex pattern of changes in earth s orbit and the change of albedo may influence the occurrence of glacial and interglacial phases this was first explained by the theory of milutin milankovic a glacier carried away the missing half of half dome in yosemite valley the present ice ages are the most studied and best understood particularly the last four zero zero zero zero zero years since this is the period covered by ice cores that record atmospheric composition and proxies for temperature and ice volume within this period the match of glacial interglacial frequencies to the milankovic orbital forcing periods is so good that orbital forcing is the generally accepted explanation the combined effects of the changing distance to the sun the precession of the earth s axis and the changing tilt of the earth s axis can change and significantly redistribute the sunlight received by the earth of particular importance are changes in the tilt of the earth s axis which impact the intensity of seasons for example the amount of solar influx in july at six five degrees north latitude is calculated to vary by as much as two five from four zero zero w m two to five zero zero w m two see graph at it is widely believed that ice sheets advance when summers become too mild to melt all of the accumulated snowfall from the previous winter some workers believe that the strength of the orbital forcing appears to be too small to trigger glaciations but feedback mechanisms like co two may explain this mismatch while milankovic forcing predicts that cyclic changes in the earth s orbital parameters can be expressed in the glaciation record additional explanations are necessary to explain which cycles are observed to be most important in the timing of glacial interglacial periods in particular during the last eight zero zero thousand years the dominant inter glacial oscillation has been one zero zero thousand years which corresponds to changes in earth s eccentricity and orbital inclination and yet is by far the weakest of the three frequencies predicted by milankovic during the period three zero zero eight million years ago the dominant pattern of glaciation corresponded to the four one thousand year period of changes in earth s obliquity tilt of the axis the reasons for preferring one frequency to another are poorly understood and an active area of current research but the answer probably relates to some form of resonance in the earth s climate system the traditional milankovitch explanation struggles to explain the dominance of the one zero zero zero zero zero year cycle over the last eight cycles richard a muller and gordon j macdonald and others have pointed out that those calculations are for a two dimensional orbit of earth but the three dimensional orbit also has a one zero zero thousand year cycle of orbital inclination they proposed that these variations in orbital inclination lead to variations in insolation as the earth moves in and out of known dust bands in the solar system although this is a different mechanism to the traditional view the predicted periods over the last four zero zero zero zero zero years are nearly the same the muller and macdonald theory in turn has been challenged by rial another worker ruddiman has suggested a plausible model that explains the one zero zero zero zero zero cycle by the modulating effect of eccentricity weak one zero zero zero zero zero year cycle on precession two three zero zero zero year cycle combined with greenhouse gas feedbacks in the four one zero zero zero and two three zero zero zero year cycles yet another theory has been advanced by peter huybers who argued that the four one zero zero zero year cycle has always been dominant but that the earth has entered a mode of climate behavior where only the two nd or three rd cycle triggers an ice age this would imply that the one zero zero zero zero zero year periodicity is really an illusion created by averaging together cycles lasting eight zero and one two zero thousand years this theory is consistent with the existing uncertainties in dating but not widely accepted at present nature four three

and most of the lakes in minnesota and wisconsin were gouged out by glaciers to be filled with water later when the glaciers melted the old teays river drainage system was radically altered and largely reshaped into the ohio river drainage system other rivers were dammed and diverted to new channels such as the niagara which formed a dramatic waterfall and gorge when the waterflow encountered a limestone escarpment another similar waterfall near syracuse new york is now dry long island was formed from glacial till and the watersheds of canada were so severely disrupted that they are still sorting themselves out the plethora of lakes on the canadian shield in northern canada can be almost entirely attributed to the action of the ice as the ice retreated and the rock dust dried winds carried the material hundreds of miles forming beds of loess many dozens of feet thick in the missouri valley isostatic rebound continues to reshape the great lakes and other areas

chemistry invented the gas filled incandescent lamp the hydrogen welding technique and was awarded the one nine three two nobel prize for chemistry for his work in surface chemistry early years irving langmuir was born in brooklyn new york on january three one one eight eight one he was the third child out of four of charles langmuir and sadie n e comings during his childhood langmuir s parents actively encouraged him to carefully observe nature and to keep a detailed record of his various observations when irving was eleven it was discovered that he had rather poor eyesight when this problem was corrected details and observations that had previously eluded him were revealed because of this his interest in nature and the various complications of nature was heightened during his childhood langmuir was greatly influenced by his older brother arthur langmuir arthur was a research chemist who also encouraged irving to be curious about nature and how things work arthur helped irving set up his first chemistry lab in the corner of his bedroom and he was always there to answer the myriad of questions that irving would pose to him which most of the time were on rather trivial matters he attended his early education at various schools and institutes in the us and in paris one eight nine two one eight nine five tycho s supernova remnant a huge ball of exploding plasma langmuir coined the name plasma because of its similarity to blood plasma and hannes alfv n noted its cellular nature he graduated with a b s from the columbia university school of mines in one nine

technology in hoboken new jersey until one nine zero nine when he began working at the general electric research laboratory schenectady new york langmuir married marion mersereau in one nine one two they had a son kenneth and a daughter barbara his initial contributions to science came from his study of light bulbs which was a continuation of his ph d work first his improvement of vacuum techniques led to the invention of the high vacuum tube a year later he and colleague lewi tonks discovered that the lifetime of a tungsten filament was greatly lengthened by filling the bulb with an inert gas such as argon which is an important part of the modern day incandescent light bulb as he continued to study filaments in vacuum and different gas environments he began to study the emission of charged particles from hot filaments thermionic emission he was one of the first scientists to work with plasmas and was the first to call these ionized gases by that name because they reminded him of blood plasma ref he introduced the concept of electron temperature and in one nine two four invented the diagnostic method for measuring both temperature and density with an electrostatic probe now called a langmuir probe and commonly used in plasma physics the current of a biased probe tip is measured as a function of bias voltage to determine the local plasma temperature and density he also discovered atomic hydrogen which he put to use by inventing the atomic hydrogen welding process later years time magazine august two eight one nine five zero following world war i langmuir contributed to atomic theory and the understanding of atomic structure by defining the modern concept of valence shells and isotopes he joined katherine blodgett to study thin films and surface adsorption they introduced the concept of a monolayer a layer of material one molecule thick and the two dimensional physics which describes such a surface in one nine three two he received the nobel prize for chemistry for his discoveries and investigations in surface chemistry in one nine three eight langmuir refuted the claim of entomologist charles h t townsend that the deer botfly flew at speeds in excess of eight zero zero miles per hour langmuir estimated the fly s true speed at two five miles per hour during world war ii langmuir worked to develop protective smoke screens and methods for de

of tax imposed upon the transfer of the property of the estate of a deceased person that is left to a living person or organisation supporters of the inheritance tax argue that it is not a death tax per se but simply a tax on a transfer of wealth opponents argue that the tax is applied to the full estate and not merely the amount transferred which arguably increases the effective transfer tax rate in the united states the tax is imposed only on the taxable estate which is generally less than the value of the full estate if an asset is left to a spouse or a charitable organization some countries do not apply the tax the tax is also imposed on other transfers of property made as an incident of the death of the owner such as a transfer of property from an intestate estate or trust or the payment of certain life insurance benefits or financial account sums to beneficiaries for uk inheritance tax see inheritance tax united kingdom united states in the united states estate and or inheritance taxes may be imposed at both the national federal level and the state level federal estate tax the federal estate tax is imposed on the transfer of the taxable estate of every decedent who is a citizen or resident of the united states see the gross estate the gross estate for federal estate tax purposes often includes more property than that included in the probate estate under the property laws of the state in which the decedent lived at the time of death the starting point for the calculation of the estate tax is the value of the gross estate defined at and as modified by certain other statutory provisions the gross estate before the modifications may be considered to be the value of all the property interests of the decedent at the time of death to these interests are added the following property interests generally not owned by the decedent at the time of death the value of property to the extent of an interest held by the surviving spouse as a dower or curtesy see the value of certain items of property in which the decedent had at any time made a transfer during the three years immediately preceding the date of death i e even if the property was no longer owned by the decedent on the date of death other than certain gifts and other than property sold for full value see the value of certain property transferred by the decedent before death for which the decedent retained a life estate or retained certain powers see the value of certain property in which the recipient could through ownership have possession or enjoyment only by surviving the decedent see the value of certain property in which the decedent retained a reversionary interest the value of which exceeded five percent of the value of the property see the value of certain property transferred by the debtor before death where the transfer was revocable see the value of certain annuities see the value of certain jointly owned property see the value of certain powers of appointment see the amount of proceeds of certain life insurance policies see the above list of modifications is not comprehensive as noted above life insurance benefits may be included in the gross estate even though the proceeds arguably were not owned by the decedent and were never received by the decedent life insurance proceeds are generally included in the gross estate if the benefits are payable to the estate or if the decedent was the owner of the life insurance policy or had any incidents of ownership over the life insurance policy such as the power to change the beneficiary designation similarly bank accounts or other financial instruments which are payable on death or transfer on death are usually included in the taxable estate even though such assets are not subject to the probate process under state law deductions the taxable estate and the tentative tax once the value of the gross estate is determined the law provides for various deductions in part iv of subchapter a of chapter one one of subtitle b of the internal revenue code in arriving at the value of the taxable estate deductions include but are not limited to funeral expenses administration expenses and claims against the estate see certain charitable contributions see certain items of property left to the surviving spouse see after subtracting the deduction amounts from the gross estate amount to arrive at the taxable estate amount the tax rate is imposed on the value of the taxable estate to compute the tentative tax tax credit the exemption equivalent and the tax however the law then provides for a credit against the tentative tax the credit may be thought of as providing in effect for an exemption equivalent or exempted value with respect to the value of the property for a person dying during two zero zero five an estate with a value less than one five zero zero zero zero zero would not pay a federal estate tax and most likely would not have to file a federal estate tax return the applicable exclusion amount increases to two zero zero zero zero zero zero for decedents dying in the years two zero zero six two zero zero seven and two zero zero eight the amount

amount any estate tax due is paid by the executor or other person responsible for administering the estate that person is also responsible for filing a form seven zero six return with the internal revenue service the return must contain detailed information as to the valuations of the estate assets and the exemptions claimed to ensure that the correct amount of tax is paid criticisms of the federal estate tax many of its opponents refer to the estate tax as the death tax and have called for its abolition since two zero zero three the top rate has dropped from five zero by one percent per year it is scheduled to drop to four five in two zero zero nine thence to zero in two zero one zero but as of two zero zero six if no further changes in the law are enacted the tax will be reimposed at a top rate of five zero in two zero one one it is possible however that congress could act in the interim and extend the abolition of the estate tax indefinitely and legislation has been introduced to this effect exemptions and tax rates as noted above a certain amount of each estate is exempted from taxation by the federal government below is a table of the amount of exemption by year an estate would expect estates above these amounts would be subject to estate tax but only for the amount above the exemption for example assume an estate of three five million in two zero zero five there are two beneficiaries who will each receive equal shares of the estate the maximum allowable credit is one five million for that year so the taxable value is therefore two million since it is two zero zero five the tax rate on that two million is four seven so the total taxes paid would be nine four zero zero zero zero each beneficiary will receive seven five zero zero zero zero of untaxed inheritance and five three zero zero zero zero from the taxable portion of their inheritance for a total of one two eight zero zero zero zero this means that they would have paid or more precisely the estate would have paid a taxable rate of two six nine year max estatetax credit marginal tax rate two zero zero two one million five zero two zero zero three one million four nine two zero zero four one five million four eight two zero zero five one five million four seven two zero zero six two million four six two zero zero seven two million four five two zero zero eight two million four five two zero zero nine three five million four five two zero one zero repealed n a inheritance tax at the state level many u s states also impose their own estate or inheritance taxes see ohio estate tax for an example some states piggyback on the federal estate tax law in regard to estates subject to tax i e if the estate is exempt from federal taxation it is also exempt from state taxation some states estate taxes however operate independently of federal law so it is possible for an estate to be subject to state tax while exempt from federal tax debate the propriety of the estate tax has been debated extensively opponents argue that the federal estate tax rate is effectively higher as a percentage of the amount actually transferred to heirs for example an estate worth three five million paid nine four zero zero zero zero federal estate tax in order to transfer one two eight zero zero zero zero to each heir suggesting an effective transfer tax rate of three six seven similarly at the limit the top federal tax rate of five zero on the estate value would imply a transfer tax rate of one zero zero of the amount transferred to heirs the high effective transfer tax rate has prompted many wealthy benefactors to make sizable gifts during their lifetime paying a gift tax on the amount transferred rather than allow the whole amount to be taxed at the estate level some argue that the estate tax creates a potential for double taxation that is taxation on assets which have already been taxed double taxation occurs on earned income but not the unrealized capital appreciation of houses farms stocks bonds real estate and collectibles such as works of art factcheck org cites a two zero zero zero study of one nine nine eight estate taxation which determined that unrealized capital gains made up three six three of the value of all estates in one nine nine eight and five six four of estates worth more than one zero million but without taking into account yearly increases of inflation the debate sometimes revolves around which estates are affected by current law the effects of the law on small business owners and family owned farms entities which conservatives argue are hardest hit by the estate tax was studied in an analysis undertaken by the tax policy center a study of the one eight eight zero zero taxable estates taxed in two zero zero four found seven zero nine zero which had any farm or business income of those there were four four zero estates in which half or more of its assets were the value of farms and or businesses the effective tax rate on the four four zero estates studied in detail never averaged more than two three proponents of the estate tax argue that it serves to prevent the perpetuation of wealth free of tax in wealthy families and that it is necessary to a system of progressive taxation proponents point out that the estate tax only affects estates of considerable size and provides numerous credits including the unified credit that allow a significant portion of even large estates to escape taxation regarding the tax s effect on farmers proponents counter that this criticism is misguided as there is an exemption built into the law that is specifically designed for family owned farms estate value number of returns average tax in thousands effective tax rate zero zero zero zero one two million one nine zero two six one six two three five million six zero one nine zero seven five three five five million four zero four four nine one two zero five one zero million eight zero one three two two one nine three one zero two zero million five zero two eight three two two two nine two zero million three zero two three four four two two two two all four four zero two two three eight one nine nine furthermore supporters argue that many large fortunes do not represent taxed income or savings that wealth is not being taxed but merely the transfer of that wealth and that many large fortunes represent unrealized capital gains which with a step up in basis will never be taxed as capital gains under the federal income tax some even go further and suggest all transfers should be taxed and that the large bequests to family foundations or private charities should be taxed and more heavily regulated related taxes the us also imposes a gift tax assessed in a manner similar to the estate tax one obvious purpose is to prevent a person from easily avoiding paying estate tax by giving away all of their assets during their lifetime however an exemption is available for transfers of up to one one zero zero zero per person per year a single donor can make gifts up to this amount to as many people as they wish each year so if they have enough people they wish to give assets to and or enough time they may be able to reduce their estate enough to avoid estate tax furthermore transfers whether by bequest gift or inheritance in excess of one million may be subject to a generation skipping transfer tax if certain

company e g stocks bonds or stock options based on material non public information which was obtained by an officer manager or other corporate insider during the performance of his duties at the corporation more formally it is simply the trading of corporate securities by corporate insiders which is often perfectly legal all insider trades whether legal or illegal must be reported in the us many investors follow the summaries of insider trades published by the securities and exchanges commission sec in the hope that mimicking these trades will be profitable legal insider trading may not be based on material non public information illegal insider trading in the us requires the participation perhaps indirectly of a corporate insider or other person who is violating his fiduciary duty to corporate shareholders by trading on or secretly relaying the corporation s information in some other countries an outsider who illegally obtains non public information which may constitute a separate offence of spying on trade secrets might also be considered an illegal inside trader trading by insiders of a corporation according to the u s sec corporate insiders are a company s officers directors and any beneficial owners of more than ten percent of a class of the company s equity securities since insiders are required to report their trades others often track these traders and there is a school of investing which follows the lead of insiders this is of course subject to the risk that an insider is making a buy specifically to increase investor confidence or making a sell for reasons unrelated to the health of the company e g a desire to diversify or buy a house as of december two zero zero five companies are required to announce times to their employees as to when they can safely trade without being accused of trading on inside information trading on material non public information there are rules against this type of insider trading in most jurisdictions around the world though the details and the efforts to enforce them vary considerably in the united states for example there is no general federal law directly prohibiting insider trading authority to prosecute cases of insider trading came from the supreme court of the united states interpretation of section one zero b of the securities exchange act of one nine three four and in particular of sec rule one zero b five prohibiting fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities see securities i scratch your back you scratch mine arrangement as long as the person receiving the information knew or should have known that the information was company property an example of illegal insider trading may be that you as an assistant to the chief executive officer learn that your company is going to be taken over before it is officially disclosed publicly knowing that such a move is likely to cause the price to rise you buy shares in the company and subsequently profit from the transaction a less dramatic but still potentially lucrative example would be trading on the quarterly earnings losses shortly before they are announced in practice prosecutions for insider trading tend to be rare and difficult to win for a variety of reasons it can be difficult to prove what the accused actually knew at the time the trades were made and people may not even be told directly but merely advised to buy or sell with a nudge and wink proving that someone has been responsible for a trade can also be difficult because a clever trader can hide behind a variety of nominees companies and proxies perhaps located offshore in jurisdictions that do not cooperate with the local authorities insider trading is usually performed by the already wealthy who can afford the best lawyers available and have the resources to drag a case out and cost the prosecutors millions along the way finally the details of insider trading can be highly confusing to non experts and convincing a randomly selected jury many with no experience of share trading that a crime has been committed can be difficult the complexity may be because the transactions are inherently complicated because the transactions were made so to evade prosecution or as brian doherty claims in reason magazine because the regulations are designed like most law to be understood by trained professionals not the citizens who have to live under it arguments in favour of insider trading although insider trading is often illegal there are arguments in its favour insider trading amounts to a consensual act between adults i e a victimless act a willing buyer and a willing seller agree to trade property which they rightfully own with no prior contract having been made between the parties to refrain from trading if equal knowledge is not possessed hence it is maintained that since traders willingly take the risk that the party on the others side of the trade is more knowledgeable no one s rights are violated many argue that insider trading is not fair however those in favor of legalizing the practice hold that making money by having superior information is what trading is all about a trader does not sell his stock unless he believes he knows information that is more indicative of the future move of a stock than his buyer and vice versa in effect the same thing is happening whether the knowledge is inside information or not someone always has superior knowledge than someone else hence the stock market by nature is not fair whether insider trading is legal or not insider trading can make markets more efficient by increasing the amount of information that is known about the company and can motivate outsiders such as analysts to increase their knowledge about the company the costs of complying with anti insider trading laws are also thus avoided nobel prize winning economist milton friedman says you want more insider trading not less you want to give the people most likely to have knowledge about deficiencies of the company an incentive to make the public aware of that friedman does not believe that the trader should be required to make his trade known to the public to reveal his identity or the reason for his trade but says that the buying or selling pressure itself is information for the market a practical counter argument to this however might be empirical research purporting to show that those markets with strongly enforced laws against insider trading tend to have lower costs of capital for security issuers see for example the world price of insider trading by utphal bhattacharya and hazem daouk in the journal of finance vol lvii no one feb two zero zero two in other words where certain individuals are permitted to buy and sell shares based on inside information other investors will be more wary and demand a premium for their investment this in turn raises the cost of capital for all issuers some of those who favour regulations against insider trading assert that market liquidity comes from confidence that all participants have equal access to information a counter argument to this is that a significant motivation of trading is the belief on the part of a trader that he has better knowledge than others do in the market and that therefore a stock is improperly priced if a stock was always accurately priced there would no point in speculative trading which would result in decreased liquidity in the market advocates of legalisation sometimes also make free speech arguments punishment for telling someone else about a development pertinent to the next day s likely stock moves would seem prima facie to be one of prohibited speech i e an act of censorship a counter argument is that information being conveyed is akin to proprietary information and that a corporate insider if he has contracted to not expose it has no more of a free speech right to tell another individual about confidential information that insider acquired by ways of his or her position than to tell others about the company s new product designs formulas or bank account passwords however communicating inside information is illegal even if it s not by a corporate insider also there is the question of why what amounts to insider trading is legal in other markets such as real estate but not in the stock market for example if a geologist knows there is a high likelihood of the discovery of petroleum under farmer smith s land he is entitled to make smith an offer for the land and buy it without first telling farmer smith or competing potential buyers of the geological data and reasoning that justify his interest if the value of the hidden oil can be acquired in such a manner in real estate transactions some ask why not unlock hidden values in the stock market through the same mechanism also although on one hand there are no laws against insider trading in the commodities markets on the other many activities such as front running are illegal for example a commodity broker can be charged with fraud if he or she receives a large purchase order from a client one likely to affect the price of that commodity and then purchases that commodity before executing the client s order in order to benefit from the anticipated price increase likewise an individual employed by the u s agricultural department for example could be charged with fraud if he or she were to receive a draft of the department s crop report before it is released to the public and then buy or sell commodities or futures contracts based on this non public information this situation was implicit in the eddie murphy movie trading places legal differences among jurisdictions the us and the uk vary in the way the law is interpreted and applied with regard to insider trading in the uk the relevant laws are the financial services act one nine eight six and the financial services and markets act two zero zero zero which defines an offence of market abuse it is not illegal to fail to trade based on inside information whereas without the inside information the trade would have taken place since from a practical point of view this is too difficult to enforce it is often legal to deal ahead of a takeover bid where a party deliberately buys shares in a company in the knowledge that it will be launching a takeover bid japan enacted its first law against insider trading in one nine eight eight roderick seeman says even today many japanese do not understand why this is illegal indeed previously it was regarded as common sense to make

agent of the nkvd to come to the aid of the spanish republic was proposed in moscow in september one nine three six by willi m nzenberg who was the chief of comintern propaganda for western europe perhaps at the suggestion by maurice thorez by the end of september the italian and french communist parties had decided to set up a column luigi longo ex leader of the italian communist youth was charged to make the necessary arrangements with the spanish government the soviet ministry of defense also helped since they had experience of dealing with corps of international volunteers there had been precedents of such corps during the russian civil war at first the idea was opposed by largo caballero but after the first setbacks of the war he changed his mind and finally agreed to the operation on two two october however the soviet union did not withdraw from the non intervention committee probably to avoid diplomatic conflict with france and britain republican propaganda poster

to jos d az was published in mundo obrero arguing that liberation for spain was a matter not only for spaniards but also for the whole of progressive humanity in a matter of days support organisations for the spanish republic were founded in most countries all more or less controlled by the comintern paths were arranged for volunteers for instance josip broz who would became famous as marshal tito was in paris to provide assistance money and passports for the volunteers from eastern europe volunteers were sent by train or ship from france to spain and sent to the base at albacete however many of them also went by themselves to spain the volunteers were under no contract nor defined engagement period which would later prove a problem american brigadists in training many italians germans and people from other countries with repressive governments joined the movement with the idea that combat in spain was a first step to restore democracy or advance a revolutionary cause in their own country there were also many unemployed workers especially from france and adventurers finally some five zero zero communists who had been exiled to russia were sent to spain among them experienced military leaders from the first world war like kl ber stern gomez zaisser lukacs zalka and gal galicz who would prove invaluable in combat the operation was met by communists with enthusiasm but by anarchists with scepticism at best at first the anarchists who controlled the borders with france were told to refuse communist volunteers and reluctantly allowed their passage after protests the first group of five zero zero men mainly french with a few exiled poles and germans arrived in albacete on one four october one nine three six they were met by international volunteers who had already

ernest hemingway would draft a ferocious portrait of marty in for whom the bell tolls marty was essentially incompetent and owed his position to the friendship with stalin he was seconded by better leaders who set up training for cavalry artillery and infantry and hospitals the french communist party provided uniforms for the brigades discipline was extreme for several months the brigades were

role of the international brigades in this victory was generally recognised sometimes even beyond reality the british ambassador sir henry childon declared that there were no spaniards in the army which had defended madrid even though the international brigades did not win the battle by themselves nor significantly change the situation they certainly did provide an example by their superb fight

madrid was the casa del campo there the nationalist troops were arabs commanded by general varela they were excellent fighters in the open but were ill trained for urban warfare a role which the

attack to close the encirclement of madrid at guadarrama the republicans sent a soviet armoured unit under general dmitry pavlov whose experience in spain would make him a future hero of the second world war and both xith and xiith international brigades violent combat resulted in stopping the nationalist advance an attack was then launched by the republic on the cordoba front the battle ended in a form of stale mate a communication was issued saying today our advance continued without loss of land poets ralph fox and john cornford were killed eventually the nationalists advanced taking the hydro electric station at el campo andr marty accused the commander of the marseillaise battalion gaston delasalle of espionage and treason and had him executed it is doubtful that delasalle would have been a spy for francisco franco he was denounced by his own second in command andr heussler who might have been a traitor himself and was later executed for treason by the french resistance during the second world war further nationalist attempts after christmas to encircle madrid met with failure not without extremely violent combat on six january one nine three seven the thaelmann battalion arrived at las rozas and held its positions virtually to the last man on the nine th only ten kilometers had been lost to the nationalists when the xiith and xivth international brigades and the one st british company arrived in madrid violent republican assaults were launched in attempt to retake the land but with little success on the one five th trenches and fortifications were built by both sides resulting in a stalemate the nationalists did not retake madrid until the very end of the war the battle of jarama on the six february one nine three seven following the fall of m laga the nationalists launched an attack on the madrid andalusia road south of madrid the nationalists quickly advanced on the little town ciempozuelos held by the xvth international brigade which was composed by the saklatvala battalion british the dimitrov battalion miscellaneous balkan nationalities the six f vrier battalion belgians and french and the abraham lincoln battalion five five zero americans many of them african american there was also a sub unit of irish men in this battle known as the connolly column this group suffered heavy blows as there was only around eight zero irish men to begin with these irish men were made up of southern irish and northern irish the northern irish comrades came from belfast derry and other counties and were charlie donnelly eddie o flaherty paul burns jackie hunt bill henry bill beattie paddy mclaughlin bill henry peter o connor peter power johnny power liam tumilson jim straney willie o hanlon ben murray and fred mcmahon from county derry came eamonn mc grotty an ex christian brother and fluent irish speaker who taught his classes through the medium of irish he died fighting alongside bob hillard from county kerry a church of ireland pastor who was wounded in the same battle and would later die from the injuries he recieved this particular instance shows the diverse backgrounds of those in the international brigades one an ex catholic christian brother the other an ordained church of ireland clergyman fighting and dying on the same side on the one one february one nine three seven all sentries of the andr marty battalion of the xivth brigade were stabbed and a nationalist brigade crossed the jarama the garibaldi battalion stopped the advance with heavy fire at another point the same tactic allowed the nationalists to deploy their troops past the river the british saklatvala battalion took most of the attack on the one two th it defended its positions under heavy artillery fire for seven hours the place became known as suicide hill at the end of the day two two five men remained of the six zero zero of the british battalion a company was made prisoner by ruse nationalists advanced amongst their ranks singing the internationale on the one seven th the republican army struck back the two three rd and the two seven th the international brigades were engaged but with little success the abraham lincoln battalion was put under great pressure with no artillery support there were one two zero killed and one seven five wounded amongst the dead was the irish poet charles donelly as in madrid the fight resulted in a stalemate since both sides had consolidated their positions to the point were no useful assault could be undertaken on the two two february one nine three seven the league of nations non intervention committee ban on foreign national volunteers went into effect the battle of guadalajara after the failed assault on the jarama the nationalists attempted another assault on madrid from the north east this time the objective was the town of guadalajara five zero kilometers from madrid the whole italian expeditionary corps three five zero zero zero men with eight zero battle tanks and two zero zero field artillery was deployed as mussolini wanted the victory to be credited to italy on nine march one nine three seven the italians made a breach in the republican lines but did not properly exploit the advance however the rest of the nationalist army was advancing and the situation appeared critical for the republicans a mixture of the best available units of the republican army was quickly set up among them the xith and xiith international brigades at dawn on one zero march one nine three seven the nationalists closed in and by noon the garibaldi battalion made its move some confusion arose from the fact that the sides were not aware of each other s moves and that both sides spoke italian this resulted in scouts from both sides exchanging information without realising they were enemies the republican lines advanced and made contact with the xith international brigade fascist battle tanks were shot at and infantry patrols came into action there took place the incident in which a fascist officer asked why italian soldiers were shooting at his party and was responded noi siamo italiani di garibaldi at which point the fascists surrendered the action went on as some sort of italian civil war in foreign land the common language was taken advantage of when the republicans used loudspeakers to broadcast propaganda messages and airplanes to drop messages promising to pay fascist deserters on the one one th the fascists broke the front of the republican army the th lmann brigade suffered heavy losses but succeeded in holding the trijueque torija road garibaldi also held its positions on the one two th republican planes and tanks attacked the thaelmann brigade attacked trijuete with bayonets and re took the town capturing numerous prisoners composition of international brigade units the first brigades to be formed were mostly composed from french belgian italian and german volunteers and were numbered as the xi xii and xiii mixed brigades according to the re organisation of the spanish army which was consituted in ten mixed brigades immediately after the failed coup these brigades mixed experienced soldiers with volunteers who had just joined but had no experience of combat there were nearly four zero zero zero zero volunteers of whom nine zero zero zero to one zero zero zero zero were french for the defense of the spanish republic most of them were workers and half of them were from paris they included a large number of veterans of the first world war which made them efficient fighters the first engagements fought by the international brigades during the battle of madrid demonstrated their military value the international brigades were mainly communists or under communist authority some were involved in the fighting in barcelona against republican opponents of the communists the poum partido obrero de unificaci n marxista an anti stalinist marxist party and anarchists however overseas volunteers from anarchist socialist liberal and other political positions also served with the brigades the battalions were often constituted by speakers of a particular nationality or language so as to ease understanding of orders they were named formally at least after heroes of the left among the predominant nationalities in each unit later in the war there was a tightening of military discipline amongst the spanish republican military and learning spanish became mandatory non spanish battalions abraham lincoln battalion predominantly volunteers from the united states the battalion was the first american military unit to be racially integrated and was at one point commanded by oliver law who became the first black man to lead white american combat troops andr marty battalion

brigades after the war the monument which honours the german brigadists in berlin czechoslovak poster celebrating the two five th anniversary of establishing the international brigades the monument honouring the french brigadists in p re lachaise cemetery since the civil war was eventually won by the nationalists the brigadists were initially on the wrong side of history especially since most of their home countries had a right wing government in france for instance the popular front was not in power anymore however since most of these countries found themselves at war with the very powers which had been fought in spain the brigadists gained some prestige as the first guard of the democracies having fought a prophetical combat retrospectively it was clear that the war in spain was as much a spanish civil war as a precursor of the coming second world war some glory was therefore accredited to the volunteers a great deal of the survivors having also fought gallantly during the world war but this soon faded in the fear that it would promote by association communism also the ambiguous stance viz germany of the communist parties in the west during the period between the hitler stalin pact and the german invasion of the soviet union contributed to widespread uneasiness when evaluating the brigadists role in the politics of the nazi era since the fall of the soviet bloc the international brigades have been quite unanimously regarded as anti fascist heroes and the legitimacy of their fight has for the most part washed away the stain of summary executions and stalinist manipulation despite being non governmental combatants swiss brigadists seven six six swiss went to fight for the republic while only four zero went on the other side it is interesting to note that the pro republicans were later prosecuted for breaking the swiss neutrality laws which prohibit swiss nationals from fighting for foreign countries while the pro fascists were never prosecuted this might be explained on one hand by the anti communism of the swiss government at the time but also because the swiss living in spain at the time nearly four zero zero zero were very much afraid of what was perceived as a communist movement the republican fighters were re habilitated in the one nine nine zero s interestingly it has been noted that the punishments of those prosecuted were very variable ranging from one five days to four months in prison but that the french speaking tribunals had been as a rule much more lenient than the german speaking ones this is very much corellated to the openly pro fascist sentiment of the elite in those parts at the time recognition of former brigadists on two six january one nine nine six the spanish government gave spanish citizenship to the brigadists at the time roughly six zero zero remained by the end of one nine three eight prime minister juan negrin had promised spanish citizenship to the brigadists a promise which had not been kept since the republic had lost the war misc symbolism and heraldic flag of the international brigades the international brigades were inheritors of a communist aesthetic which explains the numerous very stylised posters about the subject the flags featured the colours of the spanish republic red yellow and purple often along with communist symbols red flags hammer and sickle fist the emblem of the

of exposing food to ionizing radiation in order to disinfest sterilize or preserve food it is like most technology involving ionizing radiation the subject of some controversy regarding its safety irradiation is used on other things as well such as medical hardware largely to avoid consumer fear of the term radiation it is often called cold pasteurization or electronic pasteurization to emphasize its similarity to the process of pasteurization food irradiation the radura logo used to show a food has been treated with radiation by irradiating food depending on the dose some or all of the microbes and insects present are killed this prolongs the life of the food in cases where microbial spoilage is the limiting factor in shelf life some foods e g herbs and spices are irradiated at such high doses five kilograys or more that they are partially sterilized it has also been shown that irradiation can delay the ripening or sprouting of fruits and vegetables and replace the need for pesticides irradiation may also create new chemicals in food that are unique to this process chemicals that would not be created by cooking or other standard food processing techniques the united nations environmental program passed the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer banning amongst other substances all non critical uses of methyl bromide the most common fumigant for post harvest quarantine treatment of fruit although in theory still permitted for quarantine applications prices of the fumigant have increased dramatically as a consequence some governments and corporations think that irradiation is a legitimate replacement for such fumigants and in consequence some large agricultural nations of the world are currently building irradiation facilities for fresh fruit although the food industry has been slow to adopt this technology on any large scale the united states department of agriculture has approved irradiation technology as an alternative treatment for fruits and vegetables that are considered hosts to a number of fruit flies and seed weevils the united nations food and agricultural organization fao have passed a motion to support this step committing the member states to implement this technology for their national phytosanitary programs processes while the term irradiation pertains to all forms of treating food products with ionizing radiation specific types of radiation treatments are used in the food industry today radurization radurization is the process of pasteurization by the use of radiation it primarily used to treat foods that have a high moisture content and a high ph the microbes that are targeted are mainly spoilage organisms meat and fish are the foods for which this process is mainly used for dryer acidic foods yeasts and molds can be denatured the treatment dose for radurization is approximately one kgy radicidation the process of radicidation is used to eliminate pathogens this process kills vegetative cells only meaning that it will not kill spores also certain radiation resistant vegetative cells can survive including some strains of the bacterium salmonella which have been found to be radiation resistant refrigeration is required for the product post treatment the dose for radicidation ranges from two five five zero kgy at this level some physical and chemical changes may be detected depending on the type of food for example leafy vegetables such as lettuce are more sensitive to irradiation than foods with a tougher consistency radappertization radappertization involves treating the product to levels of radiation of approximately three zero kgy this high level of radiation kills all vegetative cells and also destroys spores from organisms such as clostridium botulinum such levels are generally deemed suffcient for clinical sterility but not usually employed on food items based on recommendations of the international consultative group on food irradiation that was formed by the joint fao iaea division many national legislation limit applicable doses to one zero kgy for many food items technologies electron beam irradiation electron beam irradiation uses electrons accelerated in an electric field to a velocity close to the speed of light international and national regulations limit the energy of the beam to guarantee that no induced radioactivity occurs electrons have cross sections many times larger than photons so that they do not penetrate the product beyond a few inches making it necessary to treat fruit and vegetables individually on the other hand treatment times are only a few seconds electron facilities rely on substantial concrete shields to protect workers and the environment from radiation exposure gamma radiation gamma radiation is radiation of photons in the gamma part of the spectrum the radiation is obtained through the use of radioisotopes generally cobalt six zero or in very few cases cesium one three seven it is the most cost effective technology and is preferred by many processors because the good penetration enables administering treatment to entire industrial pallets or totes greatly reducing the need for material handling a pallet or tote is typically exposed for several minutes depending on dose the environment is protected by a large concrete shield with most designs the radioisotope can be lowered into a water storage pool in order to allow maintenance personnel to enter the radiation shield in this mode the water in the pool absorbs practically all radiation providing a safe working environment for plant personnel other not commonly used designs feature dry storage by providing movable shields that eliminate radiation levels in areas of the irradiation chamber one variant of gamma irradiators keeps the cobalt six zero under water at all times and lowers the product to be irradiated under water in hermetic bells no shielding is required for such designs x ray irradiation similar to gamma radiation x rays are a lower energy substitute for the former these systems are scalable and have good penetration with the added benefit of using an electronic source that stops radiating when switched off they also permit very good dose uniformity however these systems require a great deal of electrical energy when operating and exposure times are longer than with gamma rays like most other types of facilities x ray systems rely on concrete shields to protect the environment from radiation public perception the effects of food irradiation have been studied for over six zero years under certain circumstances some research suggests that irradiation forms new chemicals in food some of which are uniquely radiolytic products however the levels of these compounds produced in irradiated foods have been deemed too low to present a meaningful risk to consumers at very high doses e g six kilogray irradiation can reduce the vitamins and other essential nutrients and negatively impact the flavor odor and texture of food at the doses typically used in irradiation treatment of food e g three five kilogray these changes appear minimal independent scientific research on the subject has been extensive leading to endorsement of food irradiation by the us food and drug administration the united states department of agriculture and the u n world health organization as a safe effective process concerns have been expressed by public health groups that irradiation by killing all bacteria in food can serve to disguise poor food handling procedures that could lead to other kinds of contamination however processors of irradiated food are subject to all existing regulations inspections and potential penalties regarding plant safety and sanitization including fines recalls and criminal prosecutions others are concerned with the safety of irradiation plants and accidents that have occurred previously the three recorded accidents on file at the iaea in the history of irradiation facilities in the world were suffered by individual employees who entered the radiation chamber disabling all available safety measures based on the intrinsic inability of the techniques used for food irradiation to induce radioactivity into the targets it is impossible for an irradiation facility to release radioactive material into the environment with the processed items any problems that might occur are therefore contained in the radiation zone of the installation radioactive sources used in irradiators are thermally hot and the repeated cycling of the source in and out of the shielding pool can cause thermal shocks that may eventually cause breakage of the cladding around the radioactive materials although this risk has been eliminated by modern source configuration this is not commonly a major problem as by far the most common isotope employed is cobalt six zero which is not water soluble making a clean up relatively simple an irradiator in the atlanta georgia area however had to be closed after the storage pool became radioactive after a leak of the water soluble cesium one three seven isotope sources as a result the us nrc has banned cesium one three seven for in water storage these concerns do not apply to electron beam or x ray irradiators or the most common cobalt six zero facilities in which the radiation is gone as soon as the source is switched off or in the case of cobalt six zero stored in water activist websites frequently quote the unknown cancer risk of radiolytic byproducts such as two dodecylcyclobutanone or two dcb as a source of concern citing mainly the work of henry delincee and beatrice luise pool zobel on several occasions has dr delincee clarified that he does not agree with the interpretation of such activists furthermore it has been established by the world health organization that sufficient research has been conducted to conclude that based on the current scientific evidence including the long term feeding studies two dcb and two alkylcyclobutanones in general do not appear to pose a health risk to consumers lastly any specific findings are specific to foods that contain triglycerides excluding many foods commonly irradiated from such concerns altogether fda has asked for repeated and conclusive testing of mutagenicity of two dcbs in irradiated meat and the study performed by sommers c h and published in october two zero zero five under the title toxicology testing of the unique radiolytic product two dodecylcyclobutanone concluding that no two dcb induced mutagenesis was observed in any of the test systems both with and without exogenous metabolic activation confirming previous findings labeling labeling laws differ from country to country in the us as in many other countries labeling regulations require the usage of the radura symbol at the point of sale together with usage of the word irradiated or treated by irradiation however the meaning of the label is not consistent the amount of irradiation used can vary and since there are no published standards the amount of pathogens effected by irradiation can be variable as well in addition there are no regulations regarding the levels of pathogen reduction that must be achieved food that is processed as an ingredient by a restaurant or food processor is exempt from the labeling requirement economics widespread food irradiation is credited for some economic benefits some foods particularly fruits and vegetables are naturally restricted from sale on the global market unless they are irradiated to prolong quality for transportation less spoilage at the receiving end means less discards lowering the unit cost irradiation has also been used to reduce bacteria counts in seafood that is shipped over long distance critics point out that the greatest food losses occur in warm moist lesser developed countries where the capital is lacking for existing storage technologies such as refrigeration and other atmospheric controls it might therefore be questionable if the most affected countries possess the resources to employ this technology according to the iaea registry however more and more facilities are licenced in such regions food irradiation does not provide a convenient total solution to food safety it is in fact one alternative in a variety of food processing techniques furthermore irradiation can not undo the effects of spoilage that has already occurred prior to treatment most national regulations therefore do not permit a decrese in higenic standards in food handling if product is to be irradiated but rather demand the same high quality prior to treatment food irradiation therefore can add to the complexity and cost of food processing if it does not replace any more costly alternative process it should also be noted that irradiation does not prevent re infestation or contamination of a product if exposed to the pathogen after treatment insect pests can have a devastating effect on crop production they can also transmit diseases that destroy crops and kill livestock and people but heavy reliance on pesticides raises environmental concerns and problems of pest adaptation and resistance hence in many countries minimizing insecticide use through the application of environmentally friendly and cost effective irradiation techniques has been given a priority alternatives there are many alternative methods of food preservation such as ultra high temperature processing vacuum packing and flash freezing however none can be so uniformly applied to such a wide range of foods as irradiation critics have stated that changes in western dietary habits and a seasonal availability of fresh produce could eliminate the need for irradiation irradiation is sometimes used to facilitate the long distance shipments of food that as with most other food may contain bacteria which could eventually cause spoilage if the food is not sold quickly in that sense it is feared by some critics that irradiation may negatively contribute in the effects of globalization claiming that a local and seasonal production may be a more effective safer

on the coil shaped design of early iuds it is a device placed in the uterus and is the world s most widely used and inexpensive method of reversible birth control the device has to be fitted inside or removed from the uterus by a doctor or qualified medical practitioner it remains in place the entire time contraception is desired depending on the type iuds can usually remain effective for two five or one zero years types of iuds there are many types of iuds worldwide but only two types currently available in the united states the copper t intrauterine device iud and the levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system lng ius photo of copper t iud the copper t iud is marketed as paragard t three eight zero a by fei women s health llc it was approved by the food and drug administration fda in one nine eight four and became available for use in one nine eight eight the device consists of a t shaped polyethylene frame that is wound with copper wire around the vertical stem and has copper bands on the lateral arms the paragard t three eight zero a is approved for up to one zero years of use although limited data support its effectiveness for at least one two years photo of lng ius the lng ius marketed by berlex laboratories as mirena consists of a t shaped polyethylene frame with a reservoir around the vertical stem that contains levonorgestrel it was approved for use by the fda in two zero zero zero initially the lng ius releases levonorgestrel at a rate of two zero g per day this rate decreases to approximately half that rate by five years it is indicated for up to five years of use although limited data support its effectiveness for at least seven years effectiveness the hormonal iud is as effective as the contraceptive pill at preventing pregnancy and the copper iuds effectiveness ranges from nine eight to over nine nine depending on the brand iuds can not protect from stds and if an infection is caught whilst using an iud it may be more likely to spread to the uterus side effects copper iuds may make menstrual periods heavier or more painful in some women especially for the first few months after they are inserted but modern types such as the gynefix have been designed so that they usually do not affect periods compare with ius iuds have remained unpopular in the usa since the dalkon shield iud which had a multi filiment string was banned after being linked to several deaths the thick woven string hosted bacteria which could spread to cause reproductive tract infections and occasionally fatalities iuds with monofiliment strings including all modern iuds are much safer and complications are very rare it is commonly believed iuds cause a greater risk of an ectopic pregnancy however recent studies have shown that women with iuds actually have fewer ectopic pregnancies than women using no contraception however in the rare cases that a pregnancy occurs with an iud in place that is not removed it is more likely to be ectopic iuds are not recommended for women who are suffering from abs and education out migration from rural prefectures continued in the late one nine eight zero s but more slowly than in previous decades in the one nine eight zero s government policy provided support for new urban development away from the large cities particularly tokyo and assisted regional cities to attract young people to live and work there regional cities offered familiarity to those from nearby areas lower costs of living shorter commutes and in general a more relaxed life style then could be had in larger cities young people continued to move to large cities however to attend universities and find work but some returned to regional cities a pattern known as u turn or to their prefecture of origin a pattern referred to as j turn

people left tokyo which experienced a net loss through migration of nearly seven three zero zero zero for the year osaka had a net loss of nearly three six zero zero zero in the same year however the prefectures showing the highest net growth are located near the major urban centers such as saitama chiba ibaraki and kanazawa around tokyo and hyogo nara and shiga near osaka and kyoto this pattern suggests a process of suburbanization people moving away from the cities for affordable housing but still commuting there for work and recreation rather than a true decentralization japanese economic

return because others might no longer consider them fully japanese by the late one nine eight zero s these problems particularly the bullying of returnee children in the schools had become a major public issue both in japan and in japanese communities abroad minorities japanese society with its ideology of homogeneity has traditionally been intolerant of ethnic and other differences people identified as different might be considered polluted the category applied historically to the outcasts of japan particularly the hisabetsu buraku discriminated communities often called burakumin a term some find offensive and thus not suitable as marriage partners or employees men or women of mixed ancestry those with family histories of certain diseases and foreigners and members of minority groups faced discrimination in a variety of forms foreign residents if japanese society is reluctant to readmit returnees it is even less willing to accept as full members of society those people who are not ethnic japanese in one nine nine one there were one two million foreign residents in japan less than one of japan s population if illegal aliens were counted the number of foreigners might be several times higher than the quoted figure of this number six nine three one zero zero about five seven were koreans and one seven one one zero zero some one four were chinese many of these people were descendants of those brought to japan during japan s occupation of taiwan one eight nine five one nine four five and korea one nine zero five four five to work at unskilled jobs such as coal mining because japanese citizenship was based on the nationality of the parent rather than on the place of birth subsequent generations were not automatically japanese and had to be naturalized to claim citizenship despite being born and educated in japan and speaking only japanese as was the case with most koreans in japan until the late one nine eight zero s people applying for citizenship were expected to use only the japanese renderings of their names and even as citizens continued to face discrimination in education employment and marriage thus few chose naturalization and they faced legal restrictions as foreigners as well as extreme social prejudice all non japanese are required by law to register with the government and carry alien registration cards from the early one nine eight zero s a civil disobedience movement encouraged refusal of the fingerprinting that accompanied registration every five years those people who opposed fingerprinting argued that it was discriminatory because the only japanese who were fingerprinted were criminals the courts upheld fingerprinting but the law was changed so that fingerprinting was done once rather than with each renewal of the registration some koreans often with the support of either south korea or the democratic people s republic of korea north korea attempted to educate their children in the korean language history and culture and to instill pride in their korean heritage most koreans in japan however have never been to the korean peninsula and do not speak korean many are caught in a vicious cycle of poverty and discrimination in a society that emphasizes japan s homogeneity and cultural uniqueness other asians too whether students or permanent residents face prejudice and a strong us them distinction europeans and north americans might be treated with greater hospitality but nonetheless find it difficult to become full members of japanese society public awareness of the place of foreigners gaijin in japanese society was heightened in the late one nine eight zero s in debates over the acceptance of vietnamese and chinese refugees and the importing of filipino brides for rural farmers a small but noticeable number of brazilian immigrants around two five zero zero zero zero also live in japan particularly those of japanese descent hisabetsu buraku main article burakumin despite popular claims of japanese homogeneity on the part of observers both foreign and domestic three native japanese minority groups can be identified the largest are the hisabetsu buraku or discriminated communities also known as the burakumin these descendants of premodern outcast hereditary occupational groups such as butchers leatherworkers funeral directors and certain entertainers may be considered a japanese analog of india s dalits discrimination against these occupational groups arose historically because of buddhist prohibitions against killing and shinto notions of pollution as well as governmental attempts at social control during the tokugawa period such people were required to live in special buraku and like the rest of the population were bound by sumptuary laws based on the inheritance of social class the meiji government abolished most derogatory names applied to these discriminated communities in one eight seven one but the new laws had little effect on the social discrimination faced by the former outcasts and their descendants the laws however did eliminate the economic monopoly they had over certain occupations although members of these discriminated communities are physically indistinguishable from other japanese they often live in urban ghettoes or in the traditional special hamlets in rural areas some attempt to pass as ordinary japanese but the checks on family background that are often part of marriage arrangements and employment applications make this difficult estimates of their number range from two million to four million or about two to three of the national population ordinary japanese claimed that membership in these discriminated communities can be surmised from the location of the family home occupation dialect or mannerisms and despite legal equality continued to discriminate against people they surmised to be members of this group past and current discrimination has resulted in lower educational attainment and socioeconomic status among hisabetsu buraku than among the majority of japanese movements with objectives ranging from liberation to encouraging integration have tried over the years to change this situation ryukyuans the second largest minority group among japanese citizens is the ryukyuan people ainu the third largest minority group among japanese citizens is the ainu who are thought to be related to the tungusic altaic and uralic peoples of siberia historically the ainu ainu means human in the ainu language were an indigenous hunting and gathering population who occupied most of northern honshu as late as the nara period a d seven one zero nine four as japanese settlement expanded the ainu were pushed northward until by the meiji period they were confined by the government to a small area in hokkaido in a manner similar to the placing of native americans on reservations characterized as remnants of a primitive circumpolar culture the fewer than two zero zero zero zero ainu in one nine nine zero were considered racially distinct and thus not fully japanese disease and a low birth rate had severely diminished their numbers over the past two centuries and intermarriage had brought about an almost completely mixed population although no longer in daily use the ainu language is preserved in epics songs and stories transmitted orally over succeeding

country demographics of japan japan has a parliamentary government which consists of three branches the administration executive branch the legislative branch and the judicial branch sovereignty is vested in japanese nationals by whom officials are elected in all of the branches there is universal adult suffrage with a fair reliable secret ballot for historical reasons the system is similar to that in the united kingdom there is dispute as to whether japan is a constitutional monarchy or a republic government main article government of japan japan officially has the traditional federal system and its four seven prefectures depend on the central government for most funding governors of prefectures mayors of municipalities and prefectural and municipal assembly members are popularly elected for four year terms sovereignty according to traditional beliefs japan was founded in six six zero bc by emperor jimmu the meiji constitution which established the modern japanese state was ratified in one eight eight nine japan was occupied by the allies from the end of world war ii in one nine four five until one nine five two sovereignty which was previously embodied in the emperor is now the domain of the people the emperor is defined as the symbol of the state national diet building in tokyo legislative by the constitution the diet is the most powerful of the three branches and consists of two houses the house of representatives and the house of councillors the diet directs the emperor in the appointment and removal of the chiefs of the executive and judicial branches at present the following political parties are represented in the national diet along with non partisans liberal democratic party ldp conservative democratic party dpj liberal social democratic the independent s club sits with the democrat party new clean government party new k meit theocratic buddhist conservative japanese communist party jcp communist social democrat party sdp social democratic liberal league ll conservative note the new conservative party hoshu shint merged with the liberal democrat party of japan on november one zero two zero zero three after its failure to win more than four seats in the election that year the ldp has been the dominant party for most of the post war period since one nine five five and is composed of a several factions which are oriented along personalistic rather than ideological lines executive the executive branch reports to the diet the chief of the executive branch the prime minister is appointed by the emperor as directed by the diet he must be a member of either house of the diet and a civilian the cabinet which he organizes must also be civilian the constitution states that the majority of the cabinet must be elected members of either house of the diet the precise wording leaving an opportunity to appoint non elected officials too the prime minister has the power to appoint and remove ministers in cases when the liberal democrat party the ldp has been in power it has been convention that the president of the ldp serves as prime minister judicial the judicial branch is independent of the other two its judges are appointed by the emperor as directed by the diet japan s judicial system drawn from customary law civil law and anglo american common law consists of several levels of courts with the supreme court as the final judicial authority the japanese constitution drawn up on may three one nine four seven includes a bill of rights similar to the united states bill of rights and the supreme court has the right of judicial review japanese courts do not use a jury system and there are no administrative courts or claims courts because of the judicial system s basis court decisions are made in accordance with legal statutes only supreme court decisions have any direct effect on later interpretation of the law see also japanese law judicial system of japan policy making despite an increasingly unpredictable domestic and international environment policy making conforms to wellestablished postwar patterns the close collaboration of the ruling party the elite bureaucracy and important interest groups often make it difficult to tell who exactly is responsible for specific policy decisions the tendency for insiders to guard information on such matters compounds the difficulty especially for foreigners wishing to understand how domestic decision making can be influenced to reduce trade problems human factor the most important human factor in the policy making process is the homogeneity of the political and business elites they tend to be graduates of a relatively small number of top ranked universities such as the university of tokyo and keio university regardless of these individuals regional or class origins their similar educational backgrounds encourage their feeling of community as is reflected in the finely meshed network of marriage alliances between top official and financial circle zaikai families the institution of early retirement also foster homogeneity in the practice of amakudari or descent from heaven as it is popularly known bureaucrats retiring in their fifties often assume top positions in public corporations and private enterprise they also become politicians by the late one nine eight zero s most postwar prime ministers had had civil service backgrounds this homogeneity facilitates the free flow of ideas among members of the elite in informal settings bureaucrats and business people that are associated with a single industry such as electronics often hold regular informal meetings in tokyo hotels and restaurants political scientist t j pempel has pointed out that the concentration of political and economic power in tokyo particularly the small geographic area of its central wards makes it easy for leaders who are almost without exception denizens of the capital to have repeated personal contact another often overlooked factor is the tendency of elite males not to be family men late night work and bar hopping schedules give them ample opportunity to hash and rehash policy matters and engage in haragei literally belly art or intimate often nonverbal communication comparable to the warriors of ancient sparta who lived in barracks apart from their families during much of their adulthood the business and bureaucratic elites are expected to sacrifice their private lives for the national good formal policy development after a largely informal process within elite circles in which ideas were discussed and developed steps might be taken to institute more formal policy development this process often took place in deliberation councils shingikai there were about two zero zero shingikai each attached to a ministry their members were both officials and prominent private individuals in business education and other fields the shingikai played a large role in facilitating communication among those who ordinarily might not meet given the tendency for real negotiations in japan to be conducted privately in the nemawashi or root binding process of consensus building the shingikai often represented a fairly advanced stage in policy formulation in which relatively minor differences could be thrashed out and the resulting decisions couched in language acceptable to all these bodies were legally established but had no authority to oblige governments to adopt their recommendations the most important deliberation council during the one nine eight zero s was the provisional commission for administrative reform established in march one nine eight one by prime minister suzuki zenko the commission had nine members assisted in their deliberations by six advisers twenty one expert members and around fifty councillors representing a wide range of groups its head keidanren president doko toshio insisted that government agree to take its recommendations seriously and commit itself to reforming the administrative structure and the tax system in one nine eight two the commission had arrived at several recommendations that by the end of the decade had been actualized these implementations included tax reform a policy to limit government growth the establishment in one nine eight four of the management and coordination agency to replace the administrative management agency in the office of the prime minister and privatization of the state owned railroad and telephone systems in april one nine nine zero another deliberation council the election systems research council submitted proposals that included the establishment of single seat constituencies in place of the multiple seat system another significant policy making institution in the early one nine nine zero s was the ldp s policy research council it consisted of a number of committees composed of ldp diet members with the committees corresponding to the different executive agencies committee members worked closely with their official counterparts advancing the requests of their constituents in one of the most effective means through which interest groups could state their case to the bureaucracy through the channel of the ruling party see also industrial policy of japan monetary and fiscal policy of japan mass media and politics in japan post war political development political parties had begun to revive almost immediately after the occupation began left wing organizations such as the japan socialist party and the japanese communist party quickly reestablished themselves as did various conservative parties the old seiyokai and rikken minseito came back as respectively the liberal party nihon jiyuto and the japan progressive party nihon shimpoto the first postwar elections were held in one nine four six women were given the franchise for the first time and the liberal party s vice president yoshida shigeru one eight seven eight one nine six seven became prime minister for the one nine four seven elections anti yoshida forces left the liberal party and joined forces with the progressive party to establish the new democratic party minshuto this divisiveness in conservative ranks gave a plurality to the japan socialist party which was allowed to form a cabinet which lasted less than a year thereafter the socialist party steadily declined in its electoral successes after a short period of democratic party administration yoshida returned in late one nine four eight and continued to serve as prime minister until one nine five four even before japan regained full sovereignty the government had rehabilitated nearly eight zero zero zero zero people who had been purged many of whom returned to their former political and government positions a debate over limitations on military spending and the sovereignty of the emperor ensued contributing to the great reduction in the liberal party s majority in the first postoccupation elections october one nine five two after several reorganizations of the armed forces in one nine five four the japan self defense forces were established under a civilian director cold war realities and the hot war in nearby korea also contributed significantly to the united states influenced economic redevelopment the suppression of communism and the discouragement of organized labor in japan during this period continual fragmentation of parties and a succession of minority governments led conservative forces to merge the liberal party jiyuto with the japan democratic party nihon minshuto an offshoot of the earlier democratic party to form the liberal democratic party jiyu minshuto ldp in november one nine five five this party continuously held power from one nine five five through one nine nine three when it was replaced by a new minority government ldp leadership was drawn from the elite who had seen japan through the defeat and occupation it attracted former bureaucrats local politicians businessmen journalists other professionals farmers and university graduates in october one nine five five socialist groups reunited under the japan socialist party which emerged as the second most powerful political force it was followed closely in popularity by the komeito clean government party founded in one nine six four as the political arm of the soka gakkai value creation society until one nine nine one a lay organization affiliated with the nichiren shoshu buddhist sect the komeito emphasized traditional japanese beliefs and attracted urban laborers former rural residents and many women like the japan socialist party it favored the gradual modification and dissolution of the japan united states mutual security assistance pact recent political developments ldp domination lasted until the diet lower house elections on july one eight one nine nine three in which the ldp failed to win a majority a coalition of new parties and existing opposition parties formed a governing majority and elected a new prime minister morihiro hosokawa in august one nine nine three his government s major legislative objective was political reform consisting of a package of new political financing restrictions and major changes in the electoral system the coalition succeeded in passing landmark political reform legislation in january one nine nine four in april one nine nine four prime minister hosokawa resigned prime minister tsutomu hata formed the successor coalition government japan s first minority government in almost four zero years prime minister hata resigned less than two months later prime minister tomiichi murayama formed the next government in june one nine nine four a coalition of his japan socialist party jsp the ldp and the small new party sakigake the advent of a coalition containing the jsp and ldp shocked many observers because of their previously fierce rivalry prime minister murayama served from june one nine nine four to january one nine nine six he was succeeded by prime minister ryutaro hashimoto who served from january one nine nine six to july one nine nine eight prime minister hashimoto headed a loose coalition of three parties until the july one nine nine eight upper house election when the two smaller parties cut ties with the ldp hashimoto resigned due to a poor electoral showing by the ldp in those upper house elections he was succeeded as party president of the ldp and prime minister by keizo obuchi who took office on july three zero one nine nine eight the ldp formed a governing coalition with the liberal party in january

conservative and reformist factions the ldp has been in power almost continuously since one nine five five when it was formed as a merger of early postwar japan s two conservative parties the liberal party of japan occupation and the democrat party of japan occupation the party is characterized as being very conservative on social and foreign matters democratic party of japan the dpj is japan s second largest party and leads the opposition it is a liberal and almost social democratic party of the left wing it is the largest opposition party and was formed in the late one nine nine zero s as a result of the merger of several anti ldp parties quite liberal and oppositional on key issues as well as moderately social democratic it is against the iraq war and is led by seiji maehara new clean government party the shin komeito party japanese name for the new clean government party is japan s third largest party and the governing party s junior partner it was formerly known as the clean government political assembly and the clean government party former the party is a conservative party of the right wing but it is also the political wing of soka gakkai an almost militant sect of nichiren buddhism therefore it is also considered a theocratic buddhist party it has moderated its stance however because it is partners with the ldp it is unopposed to the war in iraq it is now led by takenori kanzaki japanese communist party the japanese communist party is japan s fourth largest party and the middle partner of the opposition coalition it is a moderate communist party of the left wing though it is communist it is a very moderate communist party and is not against religion and does not want the emperor to step down it supports multi party democracy and does not advocate the imposition of radical change on japanese society that is why the communists have more seats than the social democrat party it is very pacifist and does not support an alliance with the united states social democratic party japan the social democrat party of japan is japan s fifth largest party and the junior partner in the opposition coalition it is a moderate social democratic party of the left wing it is seen more as a moderate social democratic and populist party rather than a revolutionary socialist party it grew out of the japan socialist party and the democratic socialist party

largest by market exchange rates its economy is highly efficient and competitive in areas linked to international trade but productivity is lower in areas such as agriculture distribution and services after achieving one of the highest economic growth rates in the world from the one nine six zero s through the one nine eight zero s the japanese economy slowed dramatically in the early one nine nine zero s when the bubble economy collapsed its reservoir of industrial leadership and technicians well educated and industrious work force high savings and investment rates and intensive promotion of industrial development and foreign trade have produced a mature industrial economy japan has few natural resources and trade helps it earn the foreign exchange needed to purchase raw materials for its economy sliding stock and real estate prices marked the end of the bubble economy of the late one nine eight zero s and ushered in a decade of stagnant economic growth real gdp in japan grew at an average of roughly one five yearly between one nine nine one one nine nine nine compared to growth in the one nine eight zero s of about four per year growth in japan throughout the one nine nine zero s was slower than growth in other major industrial nations and the same as france and germany japan endured periods of recession around the turn of the millennium exacerbated by recession in the united states but from two zero zero three began to grow strongly again at two zero and this rate has held steady through two zero zero four and projected by a survey of economists through two zero zero five japan has already achieved over five growth in the first half of two zero zero five natural resources a mountainous island nation japan has inadequate natural resources to support its growing economy and large population although many kinds of minerals were extracted throughout the country most mineral resources had to be imported in the postwar era local deposits of metal bearing ores were difficult to process because they were low grade the nation s large and varied forest resources which covered seven zero percent of the country in the late one nine eight zero s were not utilized extensively because of the precipitous terrain underdeveloped road network and high percentage of young trees domestic sources were only able to supply between two five and three zero percent of the nation s timber needs agriculture and fishing were the best developed resources but only through years of painstaking investment and toil the nation therefore built up the manufacturing and processing industries to convert raw materials imported from abroad this strategy of economic development necessitated the establishment of a strong economic infrastructure to provide the needed energy transportation communications and technological know how given its heavy dependence on imported energy japan has aimed to diversify its sources since the oil shocks of the one nine seven zero s japan has reduced dependence on petroleum as a source of energy from more than seven five in one nine seven three to about five seven at present other important energy sources are coal liquefied natural gas nuclear power and hydropower demand for oil is also dampened by higher government taxes on automobile engines over two zero zero zero cc as well as on gasoline itself currently five four yen per liter sold retail kerosene is also used extensively for home heating in portable heaters especially farther north many taxi companies run their fleets on liquefied gas with tanks in the car trunks a recent success towards greater fuel economy was the introduction of mass produced hybrid vehicles see also energy production in japan deposits of gold magnesium and silver meet current industrial demands but japan is dependent on foreign sources for many of the minerals essential to modern industry iron ore coke copper and bauxite must be imported as must many forest products agriculture only one five of japan s land is suitable for cultivation the agricultural economy is highly subsidized and protected with per unit area crop yields among the highest in the world japan maintains an overall agricultural self sufficiency rate of about five zero on fewer than five six zero zero zero km one four million acres cultivated japan normally produces a slight surplus of rice but imports large quantities of wheat sorghum and soybeans primarily from the united states japan is the largest market for u s agricultural exports potatoes are also grown mostly in hokkaido as well as where they were first introduced by dutch traders in nagasaki in the late one eight th century industry the nation s industrial activities including mining manufacturing and power gas and water utilities contributed four six six of total domestic industrial production in one nine eight nine up slightly from four five eight percent in one nine seven five this steady performance of the industrial sector in the one nine seven zero s and one nine eight zero s was a result of the growth of high technology industries during this period some of the older heavy industries such as steel and shipbuilding either declined or simply held stable together with the construction industry those older heavy industries employed three four nine of the work force in one nine eight nine relatively unchanged from three four eight percent in one nine eight zero the service industry sector grew the fastest in the one nine eight zero s in terms of gnp while the greatest losses occurred in agriculture forestry mining and transportation most industry catered to the domestic market but exports were important for several key commodities in general industries relatively geared toward exports over imports in one nine eight eight were transportation equipment with a two four eight percent ratio of exports over imports motor vehicles five four percent electrical machinery two three four percent general machinery two one two percent and metal products eight two percent industry is concentrated in several regions in the following order of importance the kant region surrounding

industrial region kinki the keihanshin industrial region the southwestern part of honsh and northern shikoku around the inland sea the setouchi industrial region and the northern part of kyushu

near nagoya the home of the automobile manufacturer the fields in which japan enjoys relatively high technological development include semiconductor manufacturing optical fibers optoelectronics optical media facsimile and copy machines industrial robots and fermentation processes japan lags slightly in such fields as satellites rockets and large aircraft where advanced engineering

of the mid to late one nine nine zero s which plagued the banking sector has shown improvement in recent years japan still has a number of long term economic issues that it must deal with the privatization of japan post the japanese postal system which also runs insurance and deposit taking businesses is a major issue a political battle over privatization caused a political stalemate in

nine five six japanese foreign policy has aimed to promote peace and prosperity for the japanese people and arguably for humanity in general by working closely with the west and supporting the united nations during the cold war japanese foreign policy was unidimensional focusing mainly on the economic realm in recent years however japan s political elites and more broadly the japanese public has shown a greater willingness to deal with security issues and support the self defense forces this is in part due to its success in disaster relief efforts at home and its participation in peacekeeping operations in cambodia in the early one nine nine zero s as well as the greater assertiveness in the first iraq war requested by the first bush administration out of japan in line with its economic power more importantly however japan s renewed focus on national security rests on an increasing sense of insecurity in the international environment owing to the rise of china and a belligerent north korea nonetheless there are still significant internal political and psychological constraints on as well as intense chinese and korean opposition to strengthening japan s defense military capabilities while maintaining its primary relationship with the united states japan has diversified and expanded its ties with other nations good relations with its neighbors continue to be of vital

the one nine six zero u s japan security treaty has been important to the peace and stability of east asia currently there are domestic discussions about possible reinterpretation of article nine of the japanese constitution all postwar japanese governments have relied on a close relationship with the united states as the foundation of their foreign policy and have depended on the mutual security treaty for strategic protection the relationship probably hit a post war nadir around the early one nine nine zero s when japanese economic dominance was seen as a threat to american power japan was the primary financer of the first iraq war yet received major criticism in some us circles for its refusal to commit actual military support following the collapse of the so called bubble economy and the nine zero s boom in the us the japanese economy was perceived as less of a threat to us interests some observers still feel that japan s willingness to deploy troops in support of current us operations in iraq as spear headed by koizumi and the conservative ldp party reflects a vow not to be excluded from the group of countries the us considers friends this decision may reflect an realpolitik understanding of the threat japan faces from a rapidly modernizing china which from its continued and indeed growing pattern of anti japanese demonstrations reveals the belief that old

japan has yet to formally express remorse for its wrongdoings in the two zero th century in regards to the statements however it is more of a debate about compensation and war reparations than over the symbolic nature of words and acknowledgments of wrongdoing and regret japan s official stance is that all war related reparation claims have been resolved except for north korea unofficial visits to the controversial yasukuni jinja by past and present prime ministers belonging to the liberal democratic party and the exclusion or generalisation some elements of japan s military history in a

was an english naturalist sometimes referred to as the father of english natural history until one six seven zero he wrote his name as john wray he published important works on plants animals and natural theology his classification of plants in his historia plantarum was an important step towards modern taxonomy ray rejected the system of dichotomous division by which species were classified according to a pre conceived either or type system and instead classified plants according to similarities and differences that emerged from observation thus he advanced scientific empiricism against the deductive rationalism of the scholastics early life ray was born in the village of black notley near braintree in the county of essex in the south east of england he is said to have been born in the smithy his father having been the blacksmith of black notley near braintree from braintree school he was sent at the age of sixteen to catharine hall cambridge whence he removed to trinity college after about one year and three quarters his tutor at trinity was james duport regius professor of greek and his intimate friend and fellow pupil the celebrated isaac barrow ray was chosen minor fellow of trinity in one six four nine and in due course became a major fellow on proceeding to the master s degree he held many college offices becoming successively lecturer in greek one six five one mathematics one six five three and humanity one six five five praelector one six five seven junior dean one six five seven and college steward one six five nine and one six six zero and according to the habit of the time he was accustomed to preach in his college chapel and also at great st mary s before the university long before he took holy orders among his sermons preached before his ordination which was not till the two three december one six six zero were the famous discourses on the wisdom of god in the creation and on the chaos deluge and dissolution of the world ray s reputation was high also as a tutor and he communicated his own passion for natural history to several pupils of whom francis willughby is by far the most famous career ray s quiet college life closed when he found himself unable to subscribe to the act of uniformity one six six one and was obliged to give up his fellowship in one six six two the year after isaac newton had entered the college we are told by dr derham in his life of ray that the reason of his refusal was not as some have imagined his having taken the solemn league and covenant for that he never did and often declared that he ever thought it an unlawful oath but he said he could not declare for those that had taken the oath that no obligation lay upon them but feared there might from this time onwards he seems to have depended chiefly on the bounty of his pupil willughby who made ray his constant companion while he lived and at his death left him six shillings a year with the charge of educating his two sons in the spring of one six six three ray started together with willughby and two other pupils on a tour through europe from which he returned in march one six six six parting from willughby at montpellier whence the latter continued his journey into spain he had previously in three different journeys one six five eight one six six one one six six two travelled through the greater part of great britain and selections from his private notes of these journeys were edited by george scott in one seven six zero under the title of mr ray s itineraries ray himself published an account of his foreign travel in one six seven three entitled observations topographical moral and physiological made on a journey through part of the low countries germany italy and france from this tour ray and willughby returned laden with collections on which they meant to base complete systematic descriptions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms willughby undertook the former part but dying in one six seven two left only an ornithology and ichthyology in themselves vast for ray to edit while the latter used the botanical collections for the groundwork of his methodus planiarurn nova one six eight two and his great historia generalis plantarum three vols one six eight six one six eight eight one seven zero four the plants gathered on his british tours had already been described in his catalogus plantarum angliae one six seven zero which work is the basis of all later english floras in one six six seven ray was elected fellow of the royal society and in one six six nine he published in conjunction with willughby his first paper in the philosophical transactions on experiments concerning the motion of sap in trees they demonstrated the ascent of the sap through the wood of the tree and supposed the sap to precipitate a kind of white coagulum or jelly which may be well conceived to be the part which every year between bark and tree turns to wood and of which the leaves and fruits are made immediately after his admission into the royal society he was induced by bishop john wilkins to translate his real character into latin and it seems he actually completed a translation which however remained in manuscript his methodus plantarum nova was in fact undertaken as a part of wilkins s great classificatory scheme in one six seven three ray married margaret oakley of launton in one six seven six he went to sutton coldfield and in one six seven seven to falborne hall in essex finally in one six seven nine he removed to black notley where he afterwards remained his life there was quiet and uneventful although he had poor health including chronic sores he occupied himself in writing books and in keeping up a wide scientific correspondence and lived in spite of his infirmities to the age of seventy six dying at black notley on one seven january one seven zero five the ray society for the publication of works on natural history was founded in his honor in one eight four four works ray s first book the catalogus plantarum circa cantabrigiam nascentium one six six zero followed by appendices in one six six three and one six eight five was written in conjunction with his amicissimus et individuus comes john nid the six two six plants are listed alphabetically but a system of classification differing little from caspar bauhin s is sketched at the end of the book and the notes contain many references to other parts of natural history the locations of the plants are minutely described and cambridge students still gather some of their rarer plants in the copses or chalk pits where he found them the book shows signs of his indebtedness to joachim jung of hamburg who had died in one six five seven leaving his writings unpublished but a manuscript copy of some of them was sent to ray by samuel hartlib in one six six zero jung invented or gave precision to many technical terms which ray and others at once made use of in their descriptions and which are now classical and his notions of what constitutes a specific distinction and what characters are valueless as such seem to have been adopted with little change by ray the first two editions of the catalogus plantarum angliae one six seven zero one six seven seven were likewise arranged alphabetically but in the synopsis stirpium rum one six nine zero one six nine six also re edited by dillenius one seven two four and by hill one seven six zero ray applied the scheme of classification which he had by that time elaborated in the methodus and the historia plantarum the methodus plantarum nova one six eight two was largely based on the works of caesalpinus and jung and still more on that of robert morison of oxford the greatest merit of this book is the use of the number of cotyledons as a basis of classification though it must be remembered that the difference between the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous embryo was detected by nehemiah grew after dividing plants into flowerless and flowering ray says floriferas dividemus in dicotyledones auarum semina sata binis foliis anomalis seminalibus dictis quae cotyledonorum usum praestant e terra exeunt yel in binos saltem lobos dividuntur quamvis eos supra terrem foliorum specie non efferunt et monocotyledones quae nec folia bina seminalia efferunt nec lobos binos condunt haec divisio ad arbores etiam extendi potest siquidem palmae et congeneres hoc respectu eodem modo a reliquis arboribus differunt quo monocotyledones a reliquis herbis but a serious blemish was his persistent separation of trees from herbs a distinction whose falsity had been exposed by jung and others but to which ray tried to give scientific foundation by denying the existence of buds in the latter at this time he based his classification like caesalpinus chiefly upon the fruit and he distinguished several natural groups such as the grasses labiatae umbelliferae and papilionaceae the classification of the methodus was extended and improved in the historia plantarum but was disfigured by a large class of anomalae to include forms that the other orders did not easily admit and by the separation of the cereals from other grasses this vast book enumerates and describes all the plants known to the author or described by his predecessors to the number according to adanson of one eight six two five species in the first volume a chapter de plantis in genere contains an account of all the anatomical and physiological knowledge of the time regarding plants with the recent speculations and discoveries of caesalpinus grew malpighi and jung and cuvier and dupetit thouars declaring that it was this chapter which gave acceptance and authority to these authors works say that the best monument that could be erected to the memory of ray would be the republication of this part of his work separately the stirpium europaearum extra britannias nascentium sylloge one six nine four is a much amplified edition of the catalogue of plants collected on his own european tour in the preface to this book he first clearly admitted the doctrine of the sexuality of plants which however he had no share in establishing here also begins his long controversy with rivinus augustus quirinus bachmann which chiefly turned upon ray s indefensible separation of ligneous from herbaceous plants and also upon what he conceived to be the misleading reliance that rivinus placed on the characters of the corolla but in the second edition of his methodus one seven zero three he followed rivinus and joseph pitton de tournefort in taking the flower instead of the fruit as his basis of classification he was no longer a fructicist but a corollist besides editing his friend willughby s books ray wrote several zoological works of his own including synopsis methodica animalium quadrupedum et serpentini generis one six nine three that is to say both mammals and reptiles and synopsis methodica aviusn et piscium one seven one three the latter was published posthumously as was also the more important historia insectorum which embodied a great mass of willughbys notes most of ray s minor works were the outcome of his faculty for carefully amassing facts for instance his collection of english proverbs one six seven zero his collection of out of the way english words one six seven four his collection of curious travels and voyages one six nine three and his dictionariolum trilingue one six seven five five th edition as nomenclator classicus one seven zero six the last was written for the use of willughby s sons his pupils it passed through many edtions and is still useful for its careful identifications of plants and animals mentioned by greek and latin writers but ray s influence and reputation have depended largely upon his two books entitled the wisdom of god manifested in the works of the creation one six nine one and miscellaneous discourses concerning the dissolution and changes of the world one six nine two the latter includes three essays on the primitive chaos and creation of the world the general deluge its causes and effects and the dissolution of the world and future conflagrations the germ of these works was contained in sermons preached long before in cambridge both books obtained immediate popularity and the former at least was translated into several languages in the wisdom of god ray recites innumerable examples of the perfection of organic mechanism the multitude and variety of living creatures the minuteness and usefulness of their parts and many if not most of the familiar examples of purposive adaptation and design in nature were suggested by him such as the structure of the eye the hollowness of the bones the camel s stomach and the hedgehog s armour legacy in one nine eight six

richard nixon in the first televised us presidential debates during the debates nixon looked tense sweaty and unshaven compared to kennedy s composure and handsomeness leading many to deem kennedy the winner although historians consider the two evenly matched as orators interestingly many who listened on radio thought nixon more impressive in the debate the debates are considered a political

five zero six returned to the island in the hope of deposing castro but the cia had underestimated popular support for castro made several mistakes in devising and carrying out the plan and the exiles did not rally the cuban people as expected by april one nine castro s government had killed or captured most of the invading exiles and kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the one one eight nine survivors after two zero months cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for five three million worth of food and medicine the incident was a major embarrassment for kennedy but he took full responsibility historians in two zero zero six ranked the debacle as the eight worst presidential mistake ever made on august one three one nine six one the east german government began construction of the berlin wall separating east berlin from the western sector of the city due to the american military presence in west berlin kennedy claimed this action was in violation of the four powers agreements kennedy initiated no action to have it dismantled and did little to reverse or halt the eventual extension of this barrier to a length of one five five km king of afghanistan zahir shah right and us president john f kennedy left the cuban missile crisis began on october one four one nine six two when american u two spy planes took photographs of a soviet intermediate range ballistic missile site under construction in cuba kennedy faced a dire dilemma if the u s attacked the sites it might have led to nuclear war with the u s s r if the u s did nothing it would endure the perpetual threat of nuclear weapons within its region in such close proximity as to make retaliation for a preemptive launch very unlikely another fear was that the u s would appear to the world as weak in its own hemisphere many military officials and cabinet members pressed for an air assault on the missile sites but kennedy ordered a naval quarantine in which the u s navy inspected all ships he began negotiations with the soviets and a week later he and soviet premier nikita khrushchev reached an agreement khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles while the u s publicly promised never to invade cuba and also secretly promised to remove u s ballistic missiles from turkey and italy within six months following this incident which brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or since kennedy was more cautious in confronting the soviet union the coat of arms of john f kennedy blazoned sable three helmets in profile or within a bordure per saltire gules and ermine arguing that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable kennedy sought to contain communism in latin america by establishing the alliance for progress which sent aid to troubled countries in the region and sought greater human rights standards in the region he worked closely with puerto rican governor luis mu oz mar n for the development of the alliance of progress as well as developments on the autonomy of the commonwealth of puerto rico another example of kennedy s belief in the ability of non military power to improve the world was the creation of the peace corps one of his first acts as president through this program which still exists today americans volunteered to help underdeveloped nations in areas such as education farming health care and construction kennedy also used limited military action to contain the spread of communism determined to stand firm against the spread of communism kennedy continued the previous administration s policy of political economic and military support for the unstable south vietnamese government which included sending military advisers and u s special forces to the area u s involvement in the area continually escalated until regular u s forces were directly fighting the vietnam war in the next administration on june two six one nine six three kennedy visited west berlin and gave a public speech criticizing communism while kennedy was speaking some people on the other side of the wall in east berlin were applauding kennedy and showing their distaste for soviet control kennedy used the construction of the berlin wall as an example of the failures of communism freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in the speech is known for its famous phrase ich bin ein berliner troubled by the long term dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear weapons proliferation kennedy also pushed for the adoption of a limited or partial test ban treaty which prohibited atomic testing on the ground in the atmosphere or underwater but does not prohibit testing underground the united states the united kingdom and the soviet union were the initial signatories to the treaty kennedy signed the treaty into law in august one nine six three and believed it to be one of the greatest accomplishments of his administration on the occasion of his visit to ireland in one nine six three president kennedy joined with irish president eamon de valera to form the american irish foundation the mission of this organization was to foster connections between americans of irish descent and the country of their ancestry kennedy furthered these connections of cultural solidarity by accepting a grant of armorial bearings from the chief herald of ireland domestic policies jfk in the oval office with various civil rights activists including martin luther king jr kennedy used the term new frontier as a label for his domestic programs it ambitiously promised federal funding for education health care for the elderly and government intervention to halt the recession kennedy also promised an end to racial discrimination the turbulent end of state sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of kennedy s era the supreme court had ruled in one nine five four that racial segregation in public schools would no longer be permitted however there were many schools especially in southern states that did not obey this decision there also remained the practice of segregation on buses in restaurants movie theaters and other public places kennedy started his fight for civil rights when he appealed to african american voters during his campaign in one nine six two in one nine six two james meredith tried to enroll at the university of mississippi but he was prevented by white students kennedy responded by sending some four zero zero federal marshals and three zero zero zero troops to ensure that meredith could enroll in his first class kennedy also assigned federal marshals to protect the freedom riders thousands of americans of all races and backgrounds joined kennedy in protesting racial discrimination kennedy supported racial integration and civil rights and during the one nine six zero campaign he telephoned coretta scott king wife of the jailed rev martin luther king jr which drew much black support to his candidacy however as president kennedy initially believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would only anger many southern whites and make it even more difficult to pass civil rights laws through congress which was dominated by southern democrats and he distanced himself from it as a result many civil rights leaders viewed kennedy as unsupportive of their efforts it is also notable that kennedy approved warrantless wiretaps and covert surveillance of king and other civil rights leaders on june one one president kennedy intervened when the governor of alabama george wallace blocked the doorway to the university of alabama to stop two black students vivian malone and james hood from enrolling george wallace moved aside after being confronted by federal marshals deputy attorney general nicholas katzenbach and the alabama national guard that evening kennedy gave his famous civil rights address on national television and radio applying the golden rule to u s race relations kennedy proposed what would become the civil rights act of one nine six four also on the domestic front in one nine six three kennedy proposed a tax reform that included income tax cuts but this was not passed by the congress until after his death in one nine six four it is one of the largest tax cuts in modern u s history surpassing the reagan tax cut of one nine eight one support of space programs jfk looks at the spacecraft friendship seven the spacecraft that made three earth orbits piloted by astronaut john glenn kennedy was eager for the united states to lead the way in the space race soviet prime minister nikita khrushchev s son sergei has said that jfk approached his father twice for a joint venture in space exploration in june one nine six one and autumn one nine six three on the first occasion russia was far ahead of america and khrushchev then said nyet no kennedy later made a speech at rice university in september one nine six two in which he said no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space and we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard on the second approach to khrushchev the soviet premier was persuaded that cost sharing was beneficial and american space technology was forging ahead the u s had launched a geostationary satellite and kennedy had asked congress to approve more than two two billion dollars for project apollo which had the goal of landing an american man on the moon before the end of the decade khrushchev agreed to a joint venture in autumn one nine six three but jfk died in november before the agreement could be formalised in one nine six nine six years after kennedy s death the project apollo goal was finally realized when neil armstrong and buzz aldrin became the first humans to land on the moon administration and cabinet kennedy s cabinet meets during the cuban missile crisis supreme court appointments kennedy appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states byron raymond white one nine six two arthur joseph goldberg one nine six two assassination and aftermath president kennedy jackie and gov john connally in the presidential limousine shortly before the assassination president kennedy was assassinated in dallas texas on friday november two two one nine six three at one two three zero pm cst while on a political trip through texas lee harvey oswald was charged at seven zero zero pm for killing dallas policeman j d tippit by murder with malice and also charged at one one three zero pm for the murder of the president there being no charge of assassination of a president at that time oswald was fatally shot less than two days later in dallas police station by jack ruby five days after oswald was killed the new president lyndon b johnson created the warren commission chaired by chief justice earl warren to investigate the assassination it concluded that oswald was the lone assassin a later investigation in the one nine seven zero s by the house select committee on assassinations hsca also concluded that oswald was the assassin however it added that he was likely part of a conspiracy to kill the president although the committee did not uncover sufficient evidence to identify any other members of the conspiracy critics have proposed a number of kennedy assassination theories which contradict the various theories on exactly how the assassination took place that have been proposed by the government s official reports there is no consensus among government investigations let alone amongst their critics on the number of bullets fired at the president the direction from which all the bullets were fired and which of the bullets struck the president and governor john connally who was also wounded in the attack lee harvey oswald denied shooting anyone and claimed he was being set up as a patsy he claimed the photograph of him holding the alleged murder weapon was a fabrication and that he would prove his face was pasted on the body of someone else holding the rifle however because of his own murder by jack ruby oswald s guilt or innocence was never determined in a court of law some critics contend that oswald was not involved at all and that he was framed among the most widely posited conspirators in the assassination are the cia the mafia the kgb and fidel castro vice president lyndon b johnson and the military industrial complex image social life and family both kennedy and his wife jackie were very young in comparison to earlier presidents and first ladies and were both extraordinarily popular in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines the kennedy brothers during the one nine six zero campaign john robert and edward ted the kennedys brought a new life and vigor to the atmosphere of the white house they believed that the white house should be a place to celebrate american history culture and achievement and invited artists writers scientists poets musicians actors nobel prize winners and athletes to visit jacqueline kennedy also gathered new art and furniture and eventually restored all the rooms in the white house the white house also seemed like a more fun youthful place because of the kennedys two young children caroline and john jr who came to be known in the popular press as john john though years later jacqueline kennedy denied that the family called him by that name outside the white house lawn the kennedys established a pre school swimming pool and tree house behind the glamorous facade the kennedys also suffered many personal tragedies jacqueline suffered a miscarriage in one nine five five and gave birth to a stillborn daughter in one nine five six although the daughter was unnamed and is buried at arlington national cemetery next to her parents with a marker reading daughter kennedy later reports indicated that the kennedys had intended to call her arabella the death of their newborn son patrick bouvier kennedy in august one nine six three was a great loss the charisma of kennedy and his family led to the figurative designation of camelot for his administration credited by his widow to his affection for the contemporary broadway musical of the same name kennedy is the third most admired person in the two zero th century according to gallup legacy the world mourned the assassinated president television became the primary source by which people kept informed of events surrounding john f kennedy s assassination with newspapers the following day becoming more souvenirs than sources of updated information u s networks switched to two four hour news coverage for the first time ever kennedy s state funeral and the murder of lee harvey oswald were all broadcast live in america and in other places around the world it was with this event that television matured as a news source rivaling that of newspapers the assassination had such an impact on every american most that were alive when first learning of the news that kennedy was assassinated vividly remember where they were when they received word u n

nearby his grave is marked with an eternal flame kennedy and william howard taft are the only two us presidents buried at arlington many of kennedy s speeches especially his inaugural address are

posthumously awarded the presidential medal of freedom in one nine six three kennedy s portrait now appears on the united states half dollar coin criticism a famous handbill circulated on november two one one nine six three in dallas texas one day before the assassination of john f kennedy kennedy is among the most popular former presidents of the united states however a number of critics argue that his reputation is largely undeserved although he was young and charismatic he had little chance to achieve much during his presidency under this reasoning his immense popularity results from the fact that his short time in office was marked by the optimistic beginnings of many programs declared to be of great benefit to the united states its people and various global issues unlike the tenures of other u s presidents kennedy s time in office generally speaking thereby lacked the scandals and controversies seen in the terms of many other presidents who served longer the civil rights act that he sent to congress in june of one nine six three was at least in part conceived by his brother and attorney general robert f kennedy and it was signed into law by his successor lyndon johnson in one nine six four kennedy and his vice president lyndon b johnson are primarily blamed for sending the first combat troops into the largely unpopular vietnam war kennedy is also blamed by millions of cubans for the bay of pigs slaughter in which thousands of cubans were killed even after being promised protection from the united states this promise was broken when kennedy backed out at the last

four three raters an outright majority of the panel considered president john f kennedy overrated an essay by akhil reed amar of yale law school faults jfk for appeasing southern democrats by stocking the lower federal bench with notorious segregationists the best civil rights judges were eisenhower appointees and with the appointment of his brother as attorney general he tried to found a political dynasty abhorred by the founding fathers the metaphor of camelot after all is ultimately un american and undemocratic conjuring up images of crowns and dashing young princes and noble birth kennedy s personal life has also attracted the ire of critics some of whom argue that lapses in judgment in his personal life impacted his professional life among the critics charges are that the kennedy family concealed from the public his serious potentially life threatening health issues e g he suffered from addison s disease and his heavy medication regimen that he had a long history of extramarital affairs and that he had alleged circuitous links to organized crime figures seymour hersh s the dark side of camelot one nine nine eight presents such a critical argument robert dallek s an unfinished life two zero zero three is a more balanced biography but contains much detail on kennedy s health issues another of kennedy s critics is u s intellectual noam chomsky whose book rethinking camelot jfk the vietnam war and us political culture one nine nine three presents an image of the kennedy administration opposite to the one that lingers in mainstream memory the book is a criticism of policy rather than his personal life and explores information not usually presented about the three five th president in particular chomsky and many other critics highlight the ill planned increased u s

considered to be one of the most influential writers of the two zero th century he is best known for his short story collection dubliners one nine one four and his novels a portrait of the artist as a young man one nine one six ulysses one nine two two and finnegans wake one nine three nine although most of his adult life was spent outside the country joyce s irish experiences are essential to his writings and provide all of the settings for his fiction and much of their subject matter his fictional universe is firmly rooted in dublin and reflects his family life and the events and friends and enemies from his school and college days due to this he became both one of the most cosmopolitan and one of the most local of all the great english language modernists life and writings dublin one eight eight two one nine zero four in one eight eight two james augustine joyce was born into a catholic family in the dublin suburb of rathgar he was the eldest of ten surviving children two of his siblings died of typhoid his father s family originally from cork once owned a small salt and lime works both joyce s paternal grandfather and his father married into wealthy families in one eight eight seven his father john stanislaus joyce was appointed rate collector by dublin corporation the family subsequently moved to the fashionable new suburb of bray around this time joyce was attacked by a dog which added them to his lifelong fear of thunderstorms a fear that had been inspired by his deeply religious aunt as a sign of god s divine wrath in one eight nine one james wrote a poem et tu healy on the death of charles stewart parnell his father had it printed and even sent a copy to the vatican library in november of that same year john joyce was entered in stubbs gazette an official register of bankruptcies and suspended from work in one eight nine three john joyce was dismissed with a pension this was the beginning of a slide into poverty for the family mainly due to john s drinking and general financial mismanagement james joyce was initially educated at clongowes wood college a boarding school in county kildare which he entered in one eight eight eight but had to leave in one eight nine two when his father could no longer pay the fees joyce then studied at home and briefly at the christian brothers school on north richmond street dublin before he was offered a place in the jesuits dublin school belvedere college in one eight nine three the offer was made at least partly in the hope that he would prove to have a vocation and join the order joyce however would reject catholicism by the age of one six although the philosophy of st thomas aquinas would remain a strong influence on him throughout his life he enrolled at the recently established university college dublin in one eight nine eight as trinity college was still off limits to catholics he studied modern languages specifically english french and italian he also became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city his review of ibsen s new drama was published in one nine zero zero and resulted in a letter of thanks from the norwegian dramatist himself joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays since lost during this period many of the friends he made at university college would appear as characters in joyce s written works after graduating from ucd in one nine zero three joyce left for paris ostensibly to study medicine but in reality he squandered money his family could ill afford he returned to ireland after a few months when his mother was diagnosed with cancer joyce refused to pray at her bedside but this seems to have had more to do with joyce s agnosticism than antagonism for his mother after she died he continued to drink heavily and conditions at home grew quite appalling he scraped a living reviewing books teaching and singing on seven january one nine zero four he wrote a portrait of the artist an essay story dealing with aesthetics in a day only to have it rejected from the free thinking magazine dana he decided on his twenty second birthday to revise the story and turn it into a novel he planned to call stephen hero the same year he met nora barnacle a young woman from connemara county galway who was working as a chambermaid on one six june one nine zero four they went on their first date an event which would be commemorated by providing the date for the action of ulysses joyce remained in dublin for some time longer drinking heavily after one of these drinking binges he got into an fight over a misunderstanding with a man in phoenix park he was picked up and dusted off by a minor acquaintance of his father s alfred h hunter who brought him into his home to tend to his injuries hunter was rumored to be a jew and to have an unfaithful wife and would serve as one of the models for leopold bloom the main protagonist of ulysses he took up with medical student oliver st john gogarty who formed the basis for the character buck mulligan in ulysses after staying in gogarty s martello tower for six nights he left in the middle of the night following an altercation which involved gogarty shooting a pistol in his direction he walked all the way back to dublin to stay with relatives for the night and sent a friend to the tower the next day to pack his trunk shortly thereafter he eloped to the continent with nora one nine zero four one nine two zero trieste and zurich joyce and nora went into self imposed exile moving first to zurich where he had supposedly acquired a post teaching english at the berlitz language school through an agent in england it turned out that the english agent had been swindled but the director of the school sent him on to trieste in austria hungary once again he found there was no position for him but with the help of almidano artifoni director of the trieste berlitz school he finally secured a teaching position in pola then part of austria hungary today part of croatia he stayed there from october one nine zero four through march one nine zero five when the austrians discovered an espionage ring in the city and expelled all aliens with artifoni s help he moved back to trieste and began teaching english he would remain in trieste for most of the next ten years later that year nora gave birth to their first child george he then managed to talk his brother stanislaus into joining him in trieste and secured him a position teaching at the school ostensibly his reasons were for his company and offering his brother a much more interesting life than the simple clerking job he had back in dublin but in truth he hoped to augment his family s meagre income with his brother s earnings stanislaus and joyce had strained relations the entire time they lived together in trieste most arguments centering around joyce s frivolity with money and drinking habits with chronic wanderlust much of his early life joyce became frustrated with life in trieste and moved to rome in late one nine zero six having secured a position working in a bank in the city he intensely disliked rome however and ended up moving back to trieste in early one nine zero seven his daughter lucia was born in the summer of the same year joyce returned to dublin in the summer of one nine zero nine with george in order to visit his father show off his son and work on getting dubliners published he visited nora s family in galway meeting them for the first time a successful visit to his relief when preparing to return to trieste he decided to bring one of his sisters eva back to trieste with him in order to help nora look after the home he would spend only a month back in trieste before again heading back to dublin this time as a representative of some cinema owners in order to set up a regular cinema in dublin the venture was successful but would quickly fall apart in his absence and he returned to trieste in january one nine one zero with another sister in tow eileen while eva became very homesick for dublin and returned a few years later eileen spent the rest of her life on the continent eventually marrying czech bank cashier frantisek schaurek joyce returned to dublin briefly in the summer of one nine one two during his years long fight with his dublin publisher george roberts over the publication of dubliners his trip was once again fruitless and on his return he wrote the poem gas from a burner as a thinly veiled invective of roberts it was his last trip to ireland and he never came closer to dublin than london again despite the many pleas of his father and invitations from fellow irish writer william butler yeats joyce came up with many money making schemes during this period of his life such as his attempt to become a cinema magnate back in dublin as well as an always discussed but never accomplished plan to import irish tweeds into trieste his expert borrowing skills kept him from ever becoming completely destitute his income was made up partially from his position at the berlitz school and partially from taking on private students many of his aquaintances through meeting these private students proved invaluable allies during his problems getting out of austria hungary and into switzerland in one nine one five one of his students in trieste was ettore schmitz better known by the pseudonym italo svevo they met in one nine zero seven and became lasting friends and mutual critics schmitz was a jew and became the primary model for leopold bloom most of the details about the jewish faith included in ulysses came from schmitz in response to joyce s queries joyce would spend most of the rest of his life on the continent it was in trieste that he first began to be plagued by major eye problems which would result in over a dozen surgeries before his death in one nine one five he moved to zurich in order to avoid the complexities of living in austria hungary during world war i where he met one of his most enduring and important friends frank budgen whose opinion joyce constantly sought through the writing of ulysses and finnegans wake it was also here where ezra pound brought him to the attention of english feminist and publisher harriet shaw weaver who would become joyce s patron providing him thousands of pounds over the next two five years and relieving him of the burden of teaching in order to focus on his writing after the war he returned to trieste briefly but found the city had changed and his relations with his brother who had been interred in an austrian prison camp for most of the war due to his pro italian politics were more strained than ever joyce headed to paris in one nine two zero at an invitation from ezra pound supposedly for a week but he ended up living there for the next twenty years one nine two zero one nine four one paris and zurich he travelled frequently to switzerland for eye surgeries and treatments for lucia who suffered from schizophrenia in paris maria and eugene jolas nursed joyce during his long years of writing finnegans wake were it not for their unwavering support along with harriet shaw weaver s unwavering financial support there is a good possibility that his books might never have been finished or published in their now legendary literary magazine transition the jolases published serially various sections of joyce s novel under the title work in progress he returned to zurich to live after the nazi occupation of france in one nine three nine he lived quietly in zurich for the next two years on one one january one nine four one he underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer while at first improved he relapsed the following day and despite several transfusions fell into a coma he awoke at two a m on one three january one nine four one and asked for a nurse to call his wife and son before losing consciousness again they were still en route when he expired fifteen minutes later he is buried in the fluntern cemetery within earshot of the lions in the zurich zoo his wife nora whom he finally married in london in one nine three one survived him by one zero years she is buried now by his side as is their son george who passed away in one nine seven six major works james joyce as depicted on the one zero note of series c of ireland dubliners joyce s irish experiences are essential to his writings and provide all of the settings for his fiction and much of their subject matter the early volume of short stories dubliners is a penetrating analysis of the stagnation and paralysis of dublin society the stories incorporate epiphanies a word used particularly by joyce by which he meant a sudden consciousness of the soul of a thing although many of joyce s works illustrate the rich tradition of the catholic church his short story araby displays his disaffection and loss of faith with the church the final and most famous story in the collection the dead was directed by john huston as his last feature film completed in one nine eight seven a portrait of the artist as a young man a portrait of the artist as a young man is a nearly complete rewrite of the abandoned stephen hero novel the original manuscript of which was partially destroyed in a fit of rage during an argument with nora a k nstlerroman or story of the development of an artist a type of bildungsroman or coming of age novel it is largely autobiographical showing the process of attaining maturity and self consciousness by a gifted young man the main character is stephen dedalus joyce s representation of himself in this novel some glimpses of joyce s later techniques are evident in the use of interior monologue and in the concern with the psychic rather than external reality joseph strick directed a film of the book in one nine seven seven starring luke johnston bosco hogan t p mckenna and john gielgud exiles and poetry despite early interest in the theatre joyce published only one play exiles begun shortly after the outbreak of world war i in one nine one four and published in one nine one eight a study of a husband and wife relationship the play looks back to the dead the final story in dubliners and forward to ulysses which was begun around the time of the play s composition joyce also published a number of books of poetry his first mature published work was the satirical broadside the holy office one nine zero four in which he proclaimed himself to be the superior of many prominent members of the celtic revival his first full length poetry collection chamber music named after the sound of urine hitting the side of a chamber pot consisted of three six short lyrics this publication led to his inclusion in the imagist anthology edited by ezra pound who was a champion of joyce s work the other poetry joyce published in his lifetime consists of gas from a burner one nine one two pomes penyeach one nine two seven and ecce puer written in one nine three two to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father it was published in collected poems one nine three six ulysses in one nine zero six as he was completing work on dubliners joyce considered adding another story featuring a jewish advertising canvasser called leopold bloom under the title ulysses the story was not written but the idea stayed with joyce and in one nine one four he started work on a novel using both the title and basic premise completing the writing in october one nine two one it was to be another three months before joyce would stop working on the proofs of the book he halted on the cusp of his self imposed deadline his four zero th birthday two february one nine two two thanks to ezra pound serial publication of the novel in the magazine the little review began in one nine one eight this magazine was edited by margaret anderson and jane heap with the backing of john quinn a new york attorney with an interest in contemporary experimental art and literature unfortunately this serialisation ran into censorship problems in the united states and in one nine two zero the editors were convicted of publishing obscenity resulting in an end to the serial publication of the novel the novel remained banned in the states until one nine three three at least partly because of this controversy joyce found it difficult to get a publisher to accept the book but it was published in one nine two two by sylvia beach from her well known left bank bookshop shakespeare and company an english edition published the same year by joyce s patron harriet shaw weaver ran into further difficulties with the united states authorities and five zero zero copies that were shipped to the states were seized and possibly destroyed the following year john rodker produced a print run of five zero zero more intended to replace the missing copies but these were burned by english customs at folkestone a further consequence of the novel s ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that a number of bootleg versions appeared most notably a number of pirate versions from the publisher samuel roth in one nine two eight a court injunction against roth was obtained and he ceased publication one nine two two was a key year in the history of english language literary modernism with the appearance of both ulysses and t s eliot s poem the waste land in ulysses joyce employs stream of consciousness parody jokes and virtually every other literary technique to present his characters the action of the novel which takes place in a single day one six june one nine zero four sets the characters and incidents of the odyssey of homer in modern dublin and represents odysseus ulysses penelope and telemachus in the characters of leopold bloom his wife molly bloom and stephen dedalus parodically contrasted with their lofty models the book explores various areas of dublin life dwelling on its squalor and monotony nevertheless the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city and joyce claimed that if dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt brick by brick using his work as a model in order to achieve this level of accuracy joyce used the one nine zero four edition of thom s directory a work that listed the owners and or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city he also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification the book consists of one eight chapters each covering roughly one hour of the day beginning around about eight a m and ending sometime after two a m the following morning each of the one eight chapters of the novel employs its own literary style each chapter also refers to a specific episode in homer s odyssey and has a specific colour art or science and bodily organ associated with it this combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal schematic structure represents one of the book s major contributions to the development of two zero th century modernist literature the use of classical mythology as a framework for his book and the near obsessive focus on external detail in a book in which much of the significant action is happening inside the minds of the characters are others nevertheless joyce complained that i may have oversystematised ulysses and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from homer joseph strick directed a film of the book in one nine six seven starring milo o shea barbara jefford and maurice ro ves sean walsh directed another version released in two zero zero four starring stephen rea angeline ball and hugh o conor finnegans wake having completed work on ulysses joyce felt he had completed his life s work but soon was at work on an even more ambitious work on one zero march one nine two three he began work on a text that was to be known first as work in progress and later finnegans wake by one nine two six he had completed the first two parts of the book in that year he met eugene and maria jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine transition for the next few years joyce worked rapidly on the new book but in the one nine three zero s progress slowed considerably this was due to a number of factors including the death of his father in one nine three one concern over the mental health of his daughter lucia and his own health problems including failing eyesight much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers including samuel beckett for some years joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend james stephens to complete on the grounds that stephens was born in the same hospital as joyce exactly one week later and shared the first name of both joyce and of joyce s fictional alter ego this is one example of joyce s numerous superstitions reaction to the early sections that appeared in transition was mixed including negative comment from early supporters of joyce s work such as pound and the author s brother stanislaus joyce in order to counteract this hostile reception a book of essays by supporters of the new work including beckett william carlos williams and others was organised and published in one nine two nine under the title our exagmination round his factification for incamination of work in progress at his four seven th birthday party at the jolases home joyce revealed the final title of the work and finnegans wake was published in book form on four may one nine three nine joyce s method of stream of consciousness literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in finnegans wake which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure language based mainly on complex multi level puns this approach is similar to but far more extensive than that used by lewis carroll in jabberwocky if ulysses is a day in the life of a city the wake is a night and partakes of the logic of dreams this has led many readers and critics to apply joyce s oft quoted description in the wake of ulysses as his usylessly unreadable blue book of eccles to the wake itself however readers have been able to reach a consensus about the central cast of characters and general plot much of the wordplay in the book stems from the use of multilingual puns which draw on a wide range of languages the role played by beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for joyce to use and as joyce s eyesight worsened of writing the text from the author s dictation the view of history propounded in this text is very strongly influenced by giambattista vico and the metaphysics of giordano bruno of nola are important to the interplay of the characters vico propounded a cyclical view of history in which civilisation rose from chaos passed through theocratic aristocratic and democratic phases and then lapsed back into chaos the most obvious example of the influence of vico s cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening and closing sentences of the book finnegans wake opens with the words riverrun past eve and adam s from swerve of shore to bend of bay brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to howth castle and environs with a pun on vico in vicus and ends a way a lone a last a loved a long the in other words the first sentence starts on the last page and the last sentence on the first turning the book into one great cycle indeed joyce said that the ideal reader of the wake would suffer from ideal insomnia and on completing the book would turn to page one and start again and so on in an endless cycle of reading joyce s legacy a bust of james joyce in st stephen s green in dublin joyce s work has been subject to intense scrutiny by scholars of all types he has also been an important influence on writers as diverse as samuel beckett jorge luis borges flann o brien m irt n cadhain salman rushdie thomas pynchon and william burroughs joyce s influence is also evident in fields other than literature the phrase three quarks for muster mark in joyce s finnegans wake is often called the source of the physicists word quark the name of one of the main kinds of elementary particles proposed by the physicist murray gell mann james gleick s book genius notes that gell mann may have found the joycean antecedent after the fact as gleick observes physicists have pronounced quark to rhyme with cork and not with mark it may be noted however against gleick s speculation that the discoverers of quarks were americans who would have pronounced quark in the american not the irish accent the french philosopher jacques derrida has written a book on the use of language in ulysses and the american philosopher donald davidson has written similarly on finnegans wake in comparison with lewis carroll vladimir nabokov esteemed ulysses greatly listing it with franz kafka s the metamorphosis as one of the two zero th century s greatest prose works however nabokov was less than thrilled with finnegans wake see strong opinions the annotated lolita or pale fire an attitude which jorge luis borges shared finnegans wake is a recurring theme in tom robbins s novel fierce invalids home from hot climates in that novel it is the favourite

japan judo was developed from jujutsu and was founded by dr jigoro kano in one eight eight two the sport became the model of the modern japanese martial arts gendai budo developed from old koryu schools practitioners of judo are called judoka history and philosophy the early history of judo and that of its founder japanese polymath and educator kano jigoro surname first in japanese one eight six zero one nine three eight are inseparable kano was born into a well to do japanese family his grandfather was a self made man a sake brewer from shiga prefecture in central japan however kano s father was not the eldest son and did not inherit the business but instead became a shinto priest and government official with enough influence for his son to enter the second incoming class of tokyo imperial university kano was a small frail boy who even in his twenties did not weigh more than a hundred pounds was often picked on by bullies he first started pursuing jujitsu at that time a flourishing art at the age of one seven but met with little success in part due to difficulties finding a teacher who would take him on as a serious student when he went off to the university to study literature at the age of one eight he continued his martial efforts eventually gaining a referral to hachinosuke fukuda a master of the tenjin shinyo ryu and ancestor of noted japanese american judoka keiko fukuda who is one of kano s oldest surviving students fukuda is said to have emphasized technique over formal exercise sowing the seeds of kano s emphasis of randori or free practice in judo little more than a year after kano joined fukuda s school fukuda took ill and died kano then became a student in another tenjin shinyo school that of masatomo iso who put more emphasis on formal kata than did fukuda through dedication kano quickly earned the title shihan or master and became assistant instructor to iso at the age of two one iso too took ill and kano feeling that he still had much to learn took up another style becoming a student of tsunetoshi iikubo of kito ryu like fukuda iikubo placed much emphasis on free practice on the other hand kito ryu emphasized throwing techniques to a much greater degree than tenjin shinyo ryu by this time kano was devising new techniques such as the kata guruma or shoulder wheel known as a fireman s carry to western wrestlers who use d a slightly different form of this technique and uki goshi floating hip toss his thoughts were already on doing more than expanding the canons of kito and tenjin shinyo ryu full of new ideas in part as a result of his education kano had in mind a major reformation of jujutsu with techniques based on sound scientific principles and with focus on development of the body mind and character of young men in addition to development of martial prowess at the age of two two just about to finish his degree at the university kano took nine students from iikubo s school to study jujitsu under him at the eishoji temple although two years would pass before it would be called by that name and kano had not yet been accorded the title of master in the kito ryu iikubo would come to the temple to help teach three days per week this was the founding of the kodokan or place for learning the way the word judo is composed of two kanji ju which means gentleness and d way or road the same character as the chinese tao thus judo literally means the gentle way or the way of giving way and may also be defined as the way of suppleness the way of flexibility or the way of adaptability to english speakers judo and jujutsu would mean the easy way as in the easiest way to accomplish something judo takes from jujutsu gentle art the principle of using one s opponent s strength against him and adapting well to changing circumstances for example if the attacker was to push against his opponent he would find his opponent stepping to the side and allowing usually with the aid of a foot to trip him up his momentum to throw him forwards the inverse being true for pulling kano saw jujutsu as a disconnected bag of tricks and sought to unify it according to some principle he found it in the notion of maximum efficiency jujitsu techniques which relied solely on superior strength were discarded or adapted in favour of those which involved redirecting the opponent s force off balancing the opponent or making use of superior leverage judo s theory of combat judo assumes that there are two main phases of combat the standing tachi waza and the ground ne waza phase each phase requires its own mostly separate techniques strategies randori conditioning and so on although some special training is devoted to transitional techniques to bridge the gap some judoka can become quite skilled in one phase and be rather weak in the other depending on where their interests most lie although most are rather balanced between the two the standing phase in the standing phase which is considered the initial phase the opponents try to throw each other to the ground even though standing joint lock and choke strangulation submission techniques are legal in the standing phase they are quite rare due to the fact that they are much harder to apply standing than throws are some judoka however are very skilled in combining takedowns with submissions where a submission technique is begun standing and finished on the ground strikes i e punches kicks etc are not allowed due to their certainty of injury but judoka are supposed to take them into consideration while training by for example not fighting in a bent over position for long since this position is vulnerable to knee strikes and others the main purpose of the throwing techniques nage waza is to take an opponent who is standing on his feet mobile and dangerous down onto his back where he cannot move any more thus the main reason for throwing the opponent is to control him and put yourself in a dominant position above him where you have more potential to inflict damage on him than he does on you be that as it may another reason to throw the opponent is to shock his body through smashing him forcefully onto the ground if a judoka executes a powerful yet fully controlled throw he can win a match outright due to the theory that he has displayed enough superiority in actual fact this kind of victory is very difficult to achieve if the opponents are equally matched therefore points are given for lesser throws in the standing phase of combat in real fight situations a throw in itself can create shock to the opponent and the impact can potentially knock the opponent unconscious depending on the hardness of the ground the ground phase in the ground phase which is considered the secondary phase of combat the opponents try to hold or get the opponent to submit either by using arm locks leg locks are not allowed due to safety regulations or by chokes and strangulations footsweeps footsweeps are used to off balance the opponent pins pins are considered important since in a real fight the person on top who has control of the person beneath can hit him with knees forearms the head and so on if a pin is held for two five seconds the person doing the pinning wins the match the reason for requiring such a long pin is that in order to be able to hit the person underneath you effectively you have to have full control of him for a long time in a match if you pin your opponent for less than two five seconds you get points depending on how long with the minimum being one zero seconds this also flows from the theory that you will be striking a pinned opponent and after one zero seconds will have possibly weakened him somewhat with strikes at least enough to merit giving some points however if the person you are holding down has wrapped his legs around any part of your lower body or your trunk he is pinning you as much as you are pinning him since you cannot get up and flee unless he lets go what if for example his friends who are nearby happen to drop in to pay you a little visit you won t be able to get away also to make things even worse for you there are various attacking techniques he can launch against you from this position which is called dojime body squeeze in japanese and the guard in english clearly you do not have control of him in this position even though you are on top so it is not considered a pin it is your job to break through his guard and pin or submit him and it is his job to submit you from where he is to roll you over and get on top of you or to simply break out and get back up to his feet and fight from there if that is what he wants to do joint locks elbow locks are considered safe enough to do at nearly full force to induce a submission in times past judo allowed many other joints to be attacked too such as the knees spine and others over the years it was discovered that attacking those other joints would not only result in many injuries to the athletes but also would gradually wear the joints down over time even so some judoka still enjoy learning and fighting each other informally using these banned techniques joint locks are effective combat techniques since they enable you to control your opponent through pain compliance also some joints such the elbows can be broken maiming your adversary so he cannot any longer attack you effectively or put up a defence for these reasons judo considers joint locks to be important techniques chokes strangulations chokes strangulations areugh their canonical status is disputed in one nine nine six gardner retired from writing james bond books due to ill health and american raymond benson quickly replaced him as a james bond novelist benson was initially controversial for being american and for ignoring much of the continuity established by gardner benson had previously written the james bond bedside companion a book dedicated to ian fleming the official novels and the films the book was initially released in one nine eight four and later updated in one nine eight eight benson also contributed to the creation of several modules in the popular james bond zero zero seven role playing game in the one nine eight zero s benson wrote six james bond novels three novelisations and three short stories benson s three short stories remain uncollected unlike previous short stories from ian fleming benson also wrote a fourth short story entitled the heart of erzulie that was rejected for publication benson abruptly resigned as bond novelist at the end of two zero zero two despite having previously announced plans to write a short story collection low sales figures for the books and plans by ian fleming publications to focus on reissuing fleming s original novels for the five zero th anniversary of the character were among reasons speculated by fans as to why benson departed the year two zero zero three marked the first year since one nine eight zero that a new james bond novel had not been published on august two eight two zero zero five ian fleming publications confirmed it is planning to publish a one off adult bond novel in two zero zero eight to mark what would have been ian fleming s one zero zero th birthday this would feature the adult version of the character as opposed to the young bond character of the recent charlie higson books see below although it has been suggested a big name author might take on the task the publishers have yet to approach anyone about this project young bond in april two zero zero four ian fleming publications glidrose announced a new series of james bond books instead of continuing from where raymond benson ended in two zero zero two the new series featured james bond as a thirteen year old boy attending eton college written by charlie higson the fast show the series is intended to align faithfully with the adult bond s back story established by fleming and fleming only since the concept was announced the series has taken heavy criticism for being aimed at the harry potter audience and has been seen by some as a desperate attempt to find a new audience for bond regardless the first novel became a bestseller in the united kingdom and was released to good reviews a second novel was released in the uk in january two zero zero six the series is currently planned out for five novels according to charlie higson the young bond series is expected to add graphic novels in two zero zero six it is currently unknown whether these will be adaptations of higson s books the moneypenny diaries a new trilogy of novels edited by samantha weinberg under the pseudonym kate westbrook entitled the moneypenny diaries was released by john murray publishers that centres on the character of miss moneypenny m s personal secretary the first installment of the trilogy subtitled guardian angel was released on october one zero two zero zero five weinberg is the first woman to write officially licensed bond related literature although johanna harwood had previously co written the screenplay for dr no the novels had originally been touted as the secret journal of a real miss moneypenny and that james bond was a possible pseudonym for a genuine intelligence officer an idea shared by john pearson s earlier biography james bond the authorised biography of zero zero seven john murray admitted on august two eight two zero zero five that the books were a spoof after an investigation by the sunday times of london ian fleming publications who had previously refused to comment as to whether the book was authorised officially confirmed the book was and always had been a project by them on the day of the book s publication a second volume has been tentatively scheduled for publication in october two zero zero six other bond related fiction in one nine six seven glidrose authorised publication of zero zero three the adventures of james bond junior written by arthur calder marshall under the pseudonym r d mascott this book is for young adult readers and chronicles the adventures of zero zero seven s nephew despite the inaccurate title in one nine nine one an animated television series james bond jr ran for six five episodes the series was mildly successful and spawned six novelisations published in one nine nine two by john peel writing as john vincent a one two issue comic book series by marvel comics published in one nine nine two as well as a video game developed by eurocom for the nes and the snes in one nine nine one russians were often the villains in fleming s cold war era novels in at least some form in one nine six eight they hit back with a spy novel of their own called avakoum zahov vs zero seven by andrei guliashki in which a communist hero finally and forcefully defeats zero zero seven in addition to numerous fan fiction pieces written since the character was created there have been two stories written by well known authors claiming to have been contracted by glidrose the first in one nine six six was per fine ounce by geoffrey jenkins a friend of ian fleming who claimed to have developed with fleming a diamond smuggling storyline similar to diamonds are forever as early as the one nine five zero s according to the book the bond files by andy lane and paul simpson soon after ian fleming died glidrose productions commissioned jenkins to write a james bond novel the novel was never published some sources have suggested that jenkins novel was to be published under the markham pseudonym the second story one nine eight five s the killing zone by jim hatfield goes so far as to have been privately published as well as claim on the cover that it was published by glidrose however it is highly unlikely that glidrose contacted hatfield to write a novel since at the time john gardner was the official author the text of the killing zone is available on the internet and can be found here in one nine nine seven the british publisher b t batsford produced your deal mr bond a collection of bridge related short stories by phillip king and robert king the title story features james bond m and other characters and features an epic bridge game between bond and the villain saladin no credit is given to ian fleming publications suggesting this rare story may have been unauthorised a photo of sean connery as bond is featured on the cover of the book in clive cussler s novel night probe there is a character named brian shaw whom the hero dirk pitt suspects to be james bond brian shaw s choice of pistol a two five caliber echoes that of james bond s preference for the two five caliber beretta shaw s old office was located in regent park and he was supposed to have been on smersh s hit list films official the james bond film series has its own traditions many of which date back to the very first movie in one nine six two since dr no every official james bond film begins with what is known as the james bond gun barrel sequence which introduces agent zero zero seven the gun barrel is seen from the assassin s perspective looking down at a walking james bond who quickly turns and shoots the scene reddens signifying the spilling of the would be assassin s blood the gun barrel dissolves to a white circle and the film begins pierce brosnan as james bond in the gun barrel sequence after the gun barrel sequence every film starting with from russia with love one nine six three would start with a pre credits teaser also popularly known as the opening gambit usually the scene features zero zero seven finishing up a previous case before taking on the case from the film and does not always relate to his main mission some of the teasers tie in with the plot of the film as in live and let die since the spy who loved me in one nine seven seven they have often involved attention grabbing action sequences which have tended to become larger and more elaborate with each successive film the one nine nine nine film the world is not enough currently holds the record as the longest bond teaser ever running more than one five minutes most teasers run for less than five title credits from goldeneye representing the fall of the soviet union and the end of the cold war when the teaser sequence is finished the opening credits begin during which an arty display of scantily clad and even discreetly naked females can be seen doing a variety of activities from dancing jumping on a trampoline to shooting weapons this sequence is a trademark and a staple of the james bond films the best known of the bond title designers is maurice binder who created these sequences for fourteen zero zero seven films from one nine six two to one nine eight nine since binder s death in one nine nine one daniel kleinman has designed the credits and has introduced cg elements not present during binder s era while the credits run the main theme of the film is usually sung by a popular artist of the time for the most part the credits are unrelated to the plot of the film although the design may reflect an overall theme for example you only live twice uses a japanese motif as well as images of a volcano both of which are elements of the movie itself goldfinger uses short glimpses of the film projected onto women s bodies for your eyes only begins with sheena easton singing the title song on screen die another day was unusual in that the images shown in that film s opening credits advance the storyline by depicting bond s torture following his capture by the north koreans the credits for goldeneye depict the fall of the soviet union and thus provide a transition from the pre fall era of the opening sequence to the post fall setting of the rest of the narrative the bond films are unusual in retaining full opening and closing credits since the late one nine seven zero s it has become common for most films to save detailed credits for the end with only principal actors and crew listed at the beginning countries james bond visited agent zero zero seven s famous introduction bond james bond became a catch phrase after it was first muttered with a cigarette in the corner of his mouth by sean connery in dr no since then the phrase has entered the lexicon of western popular culture as the epitome of polished understated machismo on june two one two zero zero five the catch phrase was honoured as the two two nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the american film institute as part of their one zero zero years series the catch phrase a martini shaken not stirred which was first uttered by bond in goldfinger although it is actually first said on screen by the villain in dr no was also honoured as nine zero on the same list every film except dr no one nine six two and thunderball one nine six five has the line james bond will return or james bond will be back during or after the final credits up until octopussy one nine eight three the end credit line would also name the next title in the film series james bond will return in over the years the films have incorrectly named the sequel three times the first one nine six four s goldfinger in early prints announced bond to return in on her majesty s secret service however the producers changed their mind shortly after release and subsequently made the correction in future prints of the film in one nine seven seven the spy who loved me stated bond would return in for your eyes only however eon productions had decided to instead take advantage of the star wars space craze and release a film adaptation of fleming s moonraker which was changed to a plot involving outer space thirdly octopussy one nine eight three incorrectly states the title of the next film as from a view to a kill the original literary title of a view to a kill every aficionado has a favourite james bond sean connery the tough guy his machismo ready beneath the polished persona george lazenby the controversial ultra macho man equally loved and despised roger moore the sophisticate a perfect gentleman rarely mussing his hair whilst saving the world timothy dalton the hard edged literary character and pierce brosnan the polished man of action on october one

is also already underway on the script for the follow up film currently referred to by its working title bond two two there s also lively debate on the best bond movie with most major film critics giving the top mark to either from russia with love connery s favourite as he re asserted in a two zero zero two abc interview with sam donaldson or its brassy followup goldfinger despite george lazenby s short tenure in the tuxedo some reviewers have also warmed to on her majesty s secret service with leonard maltin s movies on tv review book stating it might have been the best bond film ever had connery appeared in it sean connery george lazenby roger moore timothy dalton pierce brosnan daniel craig unofficial in one nine five four cbs paid ian fleming one zero zero zero usd for the rights to adapt casino royale into a one hour television adventure as part of their climax series the episode featured american barry nelson in the role of jimmy bond an agent for the fictional combined intelligence agency the rights to casino royale were subsequently sold to producer charles k feldman who turned fleming s first novel into a spoof featuring actor david niven as one of six james bonds the instrumental theme music was a hit for herb alpert and the tijuana brass for more information see the history of casino royale when plans for a james bond film were scrapped in the late one nine five zero s a story treatment entitled thunderball written by ian fleming kevin mcclory and jack whittingham was adapted as fleming s ninth bond novel initially the novel only credited fleming mcclory filed a lawsuit that would eventually award him the film rights to the novel in one nine six three afterwards mcclory made a deal with eon productions to produce a film adaptation starring sean connery the deal specifically stated that mcclory couldn t reproduce another adaptation until a set period of time had elapsed mcclory did so in one nine eight three by producing the film never say never again which featured sean connery for a seventh time as zero zero seven never say never again was not made by broccoli s production company eon productions and is therefore not considered a part of the official film series a second attempt by mcclory to remake thunderball in the one nine nine zero s with sony pictures was halted by legal action which resulted in sony pictures abandoning their aspirations for a rival james bond series mcclory to this day still claims to own the film rights to thunderball though mgm and eon claim those rights have expired for more in depth information see the controversy over thunderball other films pertaining to james bond james bond has long been a household name and remains a huge influence within the cinematic spy film genre the austin powers series by writer and actor mike myers and other parodies such as johnny english two zero zero three the flint series starring james coburn as derek flint and casino royale one nine six seven are testaments to bond s prominence in popular culture one nine six zero s tv imitations of james bond such as i spy get smart the wild wild west and the man from u n c l e went on to become popular successes in their own right the latter having had contributions by fleming towards its creation the show s lead character napoleon solo was named after a character in fleming s novel goldfinger and fleming also suggested the character name april dancer which was later used in the spinoff series the girl from u n c l e a reunion television movie the return of the man from u n c l e one nine eight three is notable for featuring a cameo by george lazenby as james bond for legal reasons his character a tribute to ian fleming was credited as jb music the james bond theme was written by monty norman and was first orchestrated by the john barry orchestra for one nine six two s dr no although the actual authorship of the music has been a matter of controversy for many years barry went on to compose the scores for eleven bond films in addition to his uncredited contribution to dr no and is credited with the creation of zero zero seven which was used as an alternate bond theme in several films and the popular orchestrated theme on her majesty s secret service both the james bond theme and on her majesty s secret service have been remixed a number of times by popular artists including art of noise moby paul oakenfold and the propellerheads barry s legacy was followed by david arnold in addition to other well known composers and record producers such as george martin bill conti michael kamen marvin hamlisch and eric serra arnold is the series current composer of choice and was recently signed to compose the score for the his fourth consecutive bond film casino royale the bond films are known for their theme songs heard during the title credits sung by well known popular singers which have included tina turner paul mccartney we have all the time in the world which serves as bond and his wife tracy s love song and whose title is bond s last line in the film is considered the unofficial theme the main theme for dr no is the james bond theme although the opening credits also include an untitled bongo interlude and concludes with a vocal calypso flavoured rendition of three blind mice entitled kingston calypso that sets the scene from russia with love also opens with an instrumental version over the title credits which then segues into the james bond theme but matt monro s vocal version also appears twice in the film including the closing credits the monro version is generally considered the film s main theme even though it doesn t appear during the opening credits video games everything or nothing was pierce brosnan s final appearance as james bond in one nine eight three the first bond video game developed and published by parker brothers was released for the atari two six zero zero the atari five two zero zero the commodore six four and the colecovision since then there have been numerous video games either based on the films or using original storylines bond video games however didn t reach their popular stride until one nine nine seven s goldeneye zero zero seven by rare for the nintendo six four subsequently virtually every bond video game has attempted to copy goldeneye zero zero seven s accomplishment and features to varying degrees of success in two zero zero four electronic arts released a game entitled goldeneye rogue agent that had nothing to do with either the video game goldeneye or the film of the same name and bond himself plays only a minor role in which he is killed in the beginning during a virtual mission similar to the climax at fort knox in the film goldfinger electronic arts has to date released seven games including the popular everything or nothing which broke away from the first person shooter element found in goldeneye and went to a third person perspective it was also the first game to feature well known actors including willem dafoe heidi klum and pierce brosnan as james bond although several previous games have used brosnan s likeness as bond in two zero zero five electronic arts released another game in the same vein as everything or nothing this time a video game adaptation of from russia with love which allowed the player to play as bond with the likeness of sean connery this was the second game based on a connery bond film the first was a one nine eight zero s text adventure adaptation of goldfinger and the first to use the actor s likeness as agent zero zero seven

force a secret espionage agency in the mission impossible television series and series of movies interdisciplinarity is a type of academic collaboration in which specialists drawn from two or more academic disciplines work together in pursuit of common goals interdisciplinary programs sometimes arise from a shared conviction that the traditional disciplines are unable or unwilling to address an important problem for example social science disciplines such as anthropology and sociology paid little attention to the social analysis of technology throughout most of the twentieth century as a result many social scientists with interests in technology have joined science and technology studies programs which are typically staffed by scholars drawn from numerous disciplines including anthropology history philosophy sociology and women s studies they may also arise from new research developments such as nanotechnology which cannot be addressed without combining the approaches of two or more disciplines examples include quantum information processing which amalgamates elements of quantum physics and computer science and bioinformatics which combines molecular biology with computer science many scientists believe that the most pressing problems facing humanity including the aids pandemic global warming and the loss of biodiversity can be solved only by developing interdisciplinary approaches multidisciplinarity there are varying degrees of interdisciplinarity in multidisciplinarity researchers from two or more disciplines work together on a common problem but without altering their disciplinary approaches or developing a common conceptual framework true interdisciplinarity occurs when researchers from two or more disciplines pool their approaches and modify them so that they are better suited to the problem at hand barriers to interdisciplinarity because most participants in interdisciplinary ventures were trained in traditional disciplines they must learn to appreciate differing perspectives and approaches for example a discipline that places more emphasis on quantitative rigor may produce practitioners who think of themselves and their discipline as more scientific than others in turn colleagues in softer disciplines may associate quantitative approaches with an inability to grasp the broader dimensions of a problem an interdisciplinary program may not succeed if its members remain stuck in their disciplines and in disciplinary attitudes from the disciplinary perspective much interdisciplinary work is soft lacking in rigor or ideologically motivated these beliefs place barriers in the career paths of those who choose interdisciplinary work for example interdisciplinary grant applications are often refereed by peer reviewers drawn from established disciplines not surprisingly interdisciplinary researchers may experience difficulty getting funding for their research in addition untenured researchers know that when they seek promotion and tenure it is likely that some of the evaluators will lack commitment to interdisciplinarity they may fear that making a commitment to interdisciplinary research will increase the risk of being denied tenure interdisciplinary programs may fail if they are not given sufficient autonomy for example it is a common practice to recruit new interdisciplinary faculty to a joint appointment with responsibilities in both an interdisciplinary program such as women s studies and a traditional discipline such as history if the traditional discipline makes the tenure decisions new interdisciplinary faculty will be hesitant to commit themselves fully to interdisciplinary work due to the existence of these and other barriers interdisciplinary research areas are strongly motivated to become disciplines themselves if they succeed they can establish their own research funding programs and make their own tenure and promotion decisions in so doing they lower the risk of entry examples of former interdisciplinary research areas that have become disciplines include neuroscience biochemistry and biomedical engineering new interdisciplinary programs universities worldwide recognize that in order to address the problems facing humanity today they must increase their commitment to interdisciplinarity for example a grass roots effort by faculty and students at stanford university resulted in a new program called bio x which explores the intersections among biology computer science medicine and engineering the program is housed in the clark center which opened in two zero zero three situated along the pathways between the university and the medical center the clark center is designed to both express and facilitate the concept of interdisciplinarity each lab is equipped with at least two scientists from each of the participating disciplines but they are by no means fixed for example walls can be moved or eliminated and all equipment is on wheels the entire building is designed to facilitate interdisciplinary communication and to accommodate new rapid and unexpected growth as it occurs a similar program has recently been instituted at truman state university in kirksville missouri undergraduate students must apply for acceptance into the program and in the process design their own major using available courses in disciplinary programs the major requires students take only two courses an introductory course to interdisciplinary studies focusing on the theory of interdisciplinarity and a senior capstone focusing on synthesis praxis the first class of idsm majors at the school were rhetoric and power philosophy in literature and gender in politics though recently biochemistry medieval studies and east asian studies were proposed

interdisciplinary fields insertion sort is a simple sort algorithm a comparison sort in which the sorted array or list is built one entry at a time it is much less efficient on large lists than the more advanced algorithms such as quicksort heapsort or merge sort but it has various advantages simple to implement efficient on quite small data sets efficient on data sets which are already substantially sorted more efficient in practice than most other simple o n two algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort the average time is n two four and it is linear in the best case stable does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys in place only requires a constant amount o one of extra memory space it is an online algorithm in that it can sort a list as it receives it in abstract terms each iteration of an insertion sort removes an element from the input data inserting it at the correct position in the already sorted list until no elements are left in the input the choice of which element to remove from the input is arbitrary and can be made using almost any choice algorithm sorting is typically done in place the result array after k iterations contains the first k entries of the input array and is sorted in each step the first remaining entry of the input is removed inserted into the result at the right position thus extending the result the array right before insertion of x becomes the array right after insertion of x with each element x copied to the right as it is compared against x the most common variant which operates on arrays can be described as suppose we have a method called insert designed to insert a value into a sorted sequence at the beginning of an array it operates by starting at the end of the sequence and shifting each element one place to the right until a suitable position is found for the new element it has the side effect of overwriting the value stored immediately after the sorted sequence in the array to perform insertion sort start at the left end of the array and invoke insert to insert each element encountered into its correct position the ordered sequence into which we insert it is stored at the beginning of the array in the set of indexes already examined each insertion overwrites a single value but this is okay because it s the value we re inserting a simple pseudocode version of the complete algorithm follows where the arrays are zero based insert array a int length value ai one value insertionsort array a int length int i one while i two time in the average and worst cases which makes it impractical for sorting large numbers of elements however insertion sort s inner loop is very fast which often makes it one of the fastest algorithms for sorting small numbers of elements typically less than one zero or so variants d l shell made substantial improvements to the algorithm and the modified version is called shell sort it compares elements separated by a distance that decreases on each pass shellsort has distinctly improved running times in practical work with two simple variants requiring o n three two and o n four three time if comparisons are very costly compared to swaps as is the case for example with string keys stored by reference then using binary insertion sort can be a good strategy binary insertion sort employs binary search to find the right place to insert new elements and therefore performs lceil ln n rceil comparisons in the worst case which is n log n the algorithm as a whole still takes n two time on average due to the series of swaps required for each insertion and since it always uses binary search the best case is no longer o n but o n log n to avoid having to make a series of swaps for each insertion we could instead store the input in a linked list which allows us to insert and delete elements in constant time unfortunately binary search on a linked list is impossible so we still spend n two time searching if we instead replace it by a more sophisticated data structure such as a heap or binary tree we can significantly decrease both search and insert time this is the essence of heap sort and binary tree sort in two zero zero four bender farach colton and mosteiro published a new variant of insertion sort called library sort or gapped insertion sort that leaves a small number of unused spaces gaps spread throughout the array the benefit is that insertions need only shift elements over until a gap is reached surprising in its simplicity they show that this sorting algorithm runs with high probability in o n log n time comparisons to other sorts insertion sort is very similar to bubble sort in bubble sort after k passes through the array the k largest elements have bubbled to the top or the k smallest elements have bubbled to the bottom depending on which way you do it in insertion sort after k passes through the array you have a run of k sorted elements at the bottom of the array each pass inserts another element into the sorted run so with bubble sort each pass takes less time than the previous one but with insertion sort each pass may take more time than the previous one some divide and conquer algorithms such as quicksort and mergesort sort by recursively dividing the list into smaller sublists which are then sorted a useful optimization in practice for these algorithms is to switch to insertion sort for small enough sublists on which insertion sort outperforms the more complex algorithms the size of list for which insertion sort has the advantage varies by environment and implementation but is typically around eight to two zero elements implementations this section shows just a few representative implementations of insertion sort for a more comprehensive list of

conflict between supporters and opponents of the anglo irish treaty of december six one nine two one which established the irish free state precursor of today s republic of ireland opponents of the treaty objected to the fact that it retained constitutional links between the united kingdom and ireland and that the six counties of northern ireland would not be included in the free state the civil war cost the lives of more than had died in the war of independence that preceded it it left irish society deeply divided and its influence in irish politics can still be seen to this day background first d il michael collins second from left front row arthur griffith fourth from left front row eamon de valera centre front row w t cosgrave second from right front row the treaty the anglo irish treaty arose from the anglo irish war or irish war of independence fought between irish separatists organised as the extra legal irish republic and the british government from one nine one nine one nine two one the treaty provided for a fully self governing irish state controlling most of ireland s population and area and having its own army and police however rather than creating the independent republic favoured by many nationalists it provided that the state would be a dominion of the british empire with the british monarch as head of state the treaty also stipulated that members of the new irish oireachtas parliament would have to take an oath of allegiance to the free state constitution and an oath of fidelity to the british king under the treaty the state was not to be called a republic but a free state and it was only to include twenty six southern and western counties of ireland the remaining six northeastern counties were to remain part of the united kingdom as northern ireland also several strategic ports were to remain occupied by the royal navy nonetheless michael collins the republican leader who had led the irish negotiating team argued that the treaty gave not the ultimate freedom that all nations aspire and develop but the freedom to achieve freedom events were eventually to prove him right as the free state later evolved into an independent republic however anti treaty militants in one nine two two believed that the treaty would never deliver full irish independence split in the nationalist movement the split over the treaty was deeply personal the protagonists on both sides had been close friends and comrades during the war of independence this made their lethal disagreement over the treaty all the more bitter michael collins felt that amon de valera had sent him to negotiate the treaty because he knew that the british would not concede an independent irish republic and wanted collins to take the blame for the compromise settlement he therefore felt deeply betrayed when de valera refused to stand by the agreement he had negotiated with david lloyd george and winston churchill the ira west cork flying column during the war of independence most of the ira units in munster were against the treaty d il ireann the parliament of the irish republic narrowly passed the anglo irish treaty by six four votes to five seven in december one nine two one following the treaty s ratification a provisional government headed by michael collins and arthur griffith was set up to transfer power from the british adminstration to the irish free state upon the treaty s ratification eamon de valera resigned as president of the republic and led the anti treaty wing of sinn f in out of the d il he challenged the right of the d il to approve the treaty saying that its members were breaking their oath to the irish republic de valera then attempted to promote a compromise in which the new irish free state would have external association with the british commonwealth rather than membership of it more seriously the majority of the irish republican army officers were also against the treaty and in march one nine two two their army convention repudiated the authority of the dail to accept the treaty the anti treaty ira formed their own army executive which they recognised as the real government of the country however both sides wanted to avoid civil war collins established an army re unification committee to re unite the ira and organised an election pact with de valera s anti treaty political followers to jointly fight the free state s first election in one nine two two and form a coalition government afterwards he also tried to reach a compromise with anti treaty ira leaders by agreeing to republican type constitution with no mention of the british monarchy for the new state ira leaders such as liam lynch were prepared to accept this compromise however the proposal for a republican constitution was vetoed by the british as being contrary to the terms of the treaty and they threatened to impose an economic blockade on free state unless the treaty was fully implemented collins reluctantly agreed this completely undermined the electoral pact between the pro and anti treaty factions who went into the irish general election one nine two two on june one eight th as hostile parties both calling themselves sinn fein the pro treaty sinn fein party won the election with two three nine one nine three votes to one three three eight six four for anti treaty sinn fein a further two four seven two two six people voted for other parties all of whom supported the treaty the election showed that the irish electorate supported the treaty and the foundation of the irish free state but de valera his political followers and most of the ira continued to oppose it de valera is quoted as saying the majority have no right to do wrong meanwhile under the leadership of michael collins and arthur griffith the pro treaty provisional government set about establishing the irish free state an organised national army to replace the ira and a new police force however since it was envisaged that the new army would be built around the ira anti treaty ira units were allowed to take over british barracks and take their arms in practice this meant that by the summer of one nine two two the provisional government of the free state controlled only dublin and some other areas like longford where the ira units supported the treaty fighting would ultimately break out when the provisional government tried to assert its authority over well armed and intransigent anti treaty ira units around the country particularly a hardline group in dublin course of the war dublin fighting the four courts along the river liffey quayside the building was occupied by anti treaty forces during the civil war whom the free state army subsequently bombarded into surrender the building was badly damaged but was fully restored after the war in april one nine two two two zero zero anti treaty ira militants led by rory o connor occupied the four courts in dublin resulting in a tense stand off these anti treaty republicans wanted to spark a new armed confrontation with the british which they hoped would unite the two factions of the ira against their common enemy however for those who were determined to make the free state into a viable self governing irish state this was an act of rebellion that would have to be put down by them rather than the british arthur griffith was in favour of using force against these men immediately but michael collins wanted at all costs to avoid civil war and left the four courts garrison alone until late june one nine two two his hand was forced by british pressure ironically the british lost patience as result of an action ordered by collins he had henry hughes wilson a retired british general assassinated in london on the two two nd of june because of his role in attacks on catholics in northern ireland winston churchill assumed that the anti treaty ira were responsable for the killing and warned collins that he would use british troops to attack the four courts unless the free state took action the final straw for the free state government came on the two seven th of june when the fourt courts republican garrison kidnaped jj ginger o connell a general in the new free state army collins made a final attempt to persuade the men holding the four courts to leave it before violence broke out they refused and collins decided to end the stand off under a british threat of imminent re occupation by the bombarding the four courts garrison into surrender collins was then appointed commander in chief of the free state army this attack was not the opening shots of the war as skirmishes had taken place between pro and anti treaty ira factions throughout the country when the british were handing over barracks however this represented the point of no return when all out war was ipso facto declared and the civil war officially began the four courts under bombardment by free state troops in one nine two two michael collins had accepted a british offer of artillery for use by the new free state army the anti treaty forces in the four courts who possessed only small arms surrendered after two days of bombardment and the storming of the building by free state troops two eight th three zero th of june one nine two two in the chaos of the moment the irish public records office which had been used as an ammunition store by the four courts garrison was the centre of a huge explosion blowing to pieces one thousand years of irish state and religious archives several anti treaty leaders notably ernie o malley escaped from captivity to continue fighting elsewhere pitched battles continued in dublin until july five as anti treaty ira units from the dublin brigade led by oscar traynor occupied o connell street provoking a week s more street fighting the republicans held out in a block of buildings until artillery was brought up under the cover of armoured cars to bombard them at point blank range oscar traynor and most of his men made their escape when the buildings they were holding caught fire among the republican casualties was republican leader cathal brugha who stayed behind in the granville hotel after traynor and most other ira men had left he was shot dead when he left the burning building alone to confront the free state troops cathal brugha was the last casualty in the battle for dublin which had cost both sides sixty five killed and twenty eight wounded in addition the free state took over five zero zero republican prisoners the civilian casualties are thought to have numbered well over two five zero cathal brugha anti treaty leader killed during the fighting on dublin s o connell st when the fighting in dublin died down the free state government was left firmly in control of the irish capital and the anti treaty forces dispersed around the country mainly to the south and west street fighting on o connell street during the irish civil war the free state s acquisition of armoured cars seen in action here was a major advantage in street fighting the outbreak of the civil war forced pro and anti treaty supporters to choose sides supporters of the treaty came to be known as pro treaty national army or free state forces its opponents were known as anti treaty irregulars or republicans and continued to refer to themselves as the ira the anti treaty ira claimed that it was defending the irish republic that had been declared in one nine one six during the easter rising that had been confirmed by the first d il and that had been invalidly set aside by those who accepted the compromise of the free state amon de valera stated that he would serve as an ordinary ira volunteer and left the leadership of the anti treaty republicans to military leaders such as liam lynch the ira chief of staff the opposing forces at the start of the civil war the ira had split down the middle the anti treaty side had considerable support among ira units particularly in the south and west of ireland in fact when the civil war broke out the anti treaty ira outnumbered the pro free state forces by roughly one five zero zero zero men to seven zero zero zero or nearly two one the paper strength of the ira in early one nine two two was over seven two zero zero zero men but most of them fought in neither the war of independence nor the civil war however the anti treaty ira lacked an effective command structure a clear strategy and sufficient arms they started the war with only six seven eight zero rifles and a handful of machine guns they also took a handful of armoured cars from british troops as they were evacuating the country more importantly the had no artillery of any kind as a result they were forced to adopt a defensive stance throughout the war by contrast the free state managed to expand its forces dramatically after the start of the war michael collins and his commanders were able to build up an army which was able to overwhelm the irregulars in the field british supplies of artillery aircraft armoured cars machine guns small arms and ammunition were much help to pro treaty forces by the end of the war the free state army had swollen to over five five zero zero zero men and three five zero zero officers far in excess of what the irish state would need to maintain in peacetime collins most ruthless officers and men were recruited from the dublin active service unit the elite unit of the ira s dublin brigade which collins had commanded in the irish war of independence and in particular from his assassination unit the squad in the new irish army they were known as the dublin guard towards the end of the war they were implicated in some gruesome atrocities against anti treaty guerrillas most of the free state army s officers were pro treaty ira officers however the bulk of the free state army was made up of unemployed irish ex servicemen who had fought in the first world war in the british army the free state takes major towns arthur griffith one eight seven one one nine two two with dublin in pro treaty hands conflict spread throughout the country with anti treaty forces briefly holding cork limerick and waterford as part of a self styled independent munster republic however the anti treaty side were not equipped to wage conventional war lacking artillery and armoured units both of which the free state obtained from the british this meant that the large towns in ireland were all easily taken by the free state after only sporadic fighting in limerick the anti treaty ira held four military barracks and most of the town fighting broke out between them and free state units in the city on the one one th of july one nine two one on the one seven th general eoin o duffy arrived with one five zero zero free state reinforcments including four armoured cars and an one eight pounder cannon after three days of street fighting the republicans evacuated the city and retreated south eight free state troops died in limerick and up to thirty republicans similarly waterford was taken by a free state column equipped with armour and artillery under general prout between the one eight th and two zero th of july at a cost of only ten killed however the free state troops encountered more tenacious resistance in the countryside around kilmallock south of limerick city when they tried to advance into republican held munster eoin o duffy s one five zero zero troops were faced with about two zero zero zero anti treaty ira men under liam deasy who had three armoured cars they had taken from the evacuating british troops fighting continued here from the two two nd of july until august the five th despite the arrival of over one zero zero zero more free state troops and more armoured cars and cannon these engagements were the closest thing in the war to a conventional battle and were costly for both sides deasy s men were ultimately forced to retreat however when free state forces were landed by sea behind them in passage west and fenit in counties cork and kerry on the two nd and eight th of august respectively these seaborne landings landed about two zero zero zero well equipped free state troops into the heart of the munster republic and caused the rapid collapse of the republican position in the south after some fighting at rochestown the badly armed anti treaty ira in cork did not try to resist this offensive but burned the barracks they were holding and dispersed on august one zero cork city was retaken the last city to fall in the munster republic liam lynch the republican commander in chief abandoned fermoy the last republican held town the following day another naval landing at clew bay in mayo helped re take the west of ireland for the free state this force consisting of four zero zero free state soldiers one cannon and an armoured car under christopher o malley re took the republican held town of westport and linked up with another free state column under sean mceoin advancing from castlebar government victories in the major towns inaugurated a period of inconclusive guerrilla warfare anti treaty ira units held out in areas such as the western part of counties cork and kerry in the south county wexford in the east and counties sligo and mayo in the west sporadic fightin also took place around dundalk where frank aiken and the fourth northern division of the irish republican army were based aiken originally wanted to stay neutral but was arrested by free state troops along with four zero zero of his men on july one six th one nine two two they subsequently broke out of prison in dundalk and conducted a guerrilla campaign against the free state along the new irish border with northern ireland it took eight more months of intermittent warfare before the war was brought to an end this period was marked by assassinations and executions of leaders formerly allied in the cause of irish independence commander in chief michael collins was assassinated by anti treaty republicans at b al na mbl th near his home in county cork in august one nine two two arthur griffith the free state president had also died of a brain haemorrhage ten days before leaving the free state government in the hands of william cosgrave and the free state army under the command of general richard mulcahy in october one nine two two eamonn de valera and the anti treaty tds members of the dail parliament set up their own republican government in opposition to the free state however by then the anti treaty side held no significant territory and de valera s government had no authority over the population in any case the ira leaders paid no attention to it seeing the republican authority as vested in their own military leaders michael collins as commander in chief at president griffith s funeral one week before his own death atrocities executions and the end of the war the final phase of the civil war november one nine two two may one nine two three degenerated into a series of atrocities that left a lasting legacy of bitterness in irish politics on october one five th one nine two two the free state s provisional government passed an emergency powers bill in the dail which allowed for the execution of men captured bearing arms against the state on november the one seven th four ira men who were captured with arms were shot by firing squad on the two four th of november acclaimed author and treaty negotiator robert erskine childers was executed by the free state having been captured in possession of a pistol liam lynch in response issued an order to the ira units under his command that any member of parliament who had signed or voted for the murder bill should be shot on sight the anti treaty ira therefore began assassinating tds who sat in the d il beginning with sean hales a number of other td s and senators were also shot and wounded in response the free state announced that it would be shooting ira prisoners already in its custody in reprisal for future outrages accordingly on december the seven th one nine two two the day after hales killing four prominent republicans one from each province who had been held since the first week of the war rory o connor liam mellows richard barett and joe mckelvey were executed in revenge for the killing of hales in all the free state sanctioned seven seven official executions of anti treaty prisoners during the civil war a number that was recalled by fianna fail members with bitterness for decades afterwards in addition free state troops particularly in county kerry where the guerrilla campaign was most bitter began unofficial killings of captured anti treaty fighters several high profile atrocities took place in the month of march one nine two three the most notorious example of this occurred at ballyseedy where in reprisal for the killing of five free state soldiers with booby trap bomb at knocknagoshel nine republican prisoners were tied to a landmine which was exploded and the remaining survivors were then machine gunned with one of the prisoners stephen fuller escaping to tell of the event afterwards this was followed by series of similar killings of prisoners by free state troops in killarney and cahersiveen richard mulcahy the free state general who instituted the policy of executions of republican prisoners in reprisal for the murder of elected representatives the anti treaty ira were unable to maintain an effective guerrilla campaign since the great majority of the irish population did not support them this was demonstrated in the elections immediately after the civil war which cumann na ngaedheal the free state party won easily see irish general election one nine two three for the results the roman catholic church also supported the free state deeming it the lawful government of the country denouncing the anti treaty ira and refusing to administer the sacraments to anti treaty fighters on october one zero th one nine two two the catholic bishops of ireland issued a formal statement describing the anti treaty campaign as a system of murder and assassination of the national forces without any legitimate authority the guerrilla warfare now being carried on by the irregulars is without moral sanction and therefore the killing of national soldiers is murder before god the seizing of public and private property is robbery the breaking of roads bridges and railways is criminal all who in contravention of this teaching participate in such crimes are guilty of grevious sins and may not be absolved in confession nor admitted to the holy communion if they persist in such evil courses coogan de valera p three four four this stance would have influenced many catholic irish people at the time the lack of public support for the anti treaty ira the determination of the government to defeat them and their lack of will also contributed to their defeat by february one nine two three republican leader liam deasy had already surrendered to free state forces and called on other republicans to do the same as the conflict petered out into a de facto victory for the pro treaty side de valera asked the ira leadership to call a ceasefire but they refused some historians suggest that the death of liam lynch the intransigent republican leader in a skirmish in the knockmealdown mountains in county waterford on april one zero th allowed the more pragmatic frank aiken who took over as ira chief of staff to call a halt to what seemed a futile struggle aiken s accession to ira leadership was followed on the three zero th of april by the declaration of a ceasefire on behalf off the anti treaty forces aiken followed this on the two four th of may one nine two three by an order to ira volunteers to dump arms rather than surrender them or continue a fight which they were incapable of winning thousands of anti treaty ira members including de valera were arrested by the free state forces in the weeks after the end of the war when they had dumped their arms and returned home attacks on loyalists although the cause of the civil war was the treaty as the war developed the irregulars sought to identify their actions with the traditional republican cause of the men of no property and the result was that the war also saw large loyalist landowners and some not very well off protestant loyalists attacked and a large number of country estates occupied by small holders many but not all of these people had supported the crown forces during the war of independence this support was often largely moral but sometimes it took the form of actively assisting the british in the conflict this made their situation post independence difficult and in the anarchy of the civil war they became easy targets sometimes these attacks had sectarian overtones although most anti treaty ira men made no distinction between catholic and protestant supporters of the irish government the free state made efforts to protect protestants and their property most notably in county louth where a special police force was set up specifically for this purpose controversy continues to this day about the extent of intimidation of protestants at this time cost and results the civil war though short was bloody it cost the lives of many senior figures including michael collins both sides carried out brutal acts the anti treaty forces murdered tds mps and burned many historic homes such as the famous moore hall in mayo because its owner had become a senator the government executed anti treaty prisoners officially and unofficially the pro treaty national army suffered eight zero zero fatalities and perhaps as many as four zero zero zero people were killed in total as their forces retreated the irregulars caused much destruction and the economy of the free state suffered a hard blow in the earliest days of its existence as a result in addition about one two zero zero zero republicans were interned by the end of the civil war most of whom were not released until one nine two four after aiken called an end to the anti treaty campaign up to eight zero zero zero ira prisoners went on hunger strike in protest at their continued detention however it has also been argued that the irish civil war could have been far worse than it actually was the numbers killed were relatively modest by the standards of other contemporary civil wars for example in russia and spain moreover the new police force the civic guards was not involved which meant that it was possible for the free state to establish an unarmed and politically neutral police service after the war the fact that the irish civil war was fought between irish nationalist factions meant that the issue of northern ireland was ignored and ireland was spared what could have been a far bloodier civil war based on ethnic and sectarian lines over the future of ireland s six north eastern counties in fact because of the irish civil war northern ireland was able to consolidate its existence and partition of ireland was confirmed for the foreseeable future collins up to the outbreak of the civil war and possibly until his death had been planning to launch a clandestine guerrilla campaign against the northern state and was funelling arms to the northern units of the ira to this end this may have led to open hostilities between north and south had the irish civil war not broken out in the event it was only after their defeat in the civil war that anti treaty irish republicans seriously considered whether to take armed action against british rule in northern ireland the northern units of the ira largely supported the free state side in the civil war due to collins s policies and over one zero zero zero of them joined the new free state s irish army in one nine two six having failed to persuade the majority of the anti treaty side of accepting the new status quo as a basis for an evolving republic a large faction led by de valera and aiken left to resume constitutional politics and to found the fianna f il party sinn fein became a small isolated poltical party the ira then much more numerous and influential than sinn fein remained associated with fianna fail though not directly until banned by de valera in one nine three five eamon de valera in the one nine three zero s as with most civil wars the internecine conflict left a bitter legacy which continues to influence irish politics to this day the two largest political parties in the republic are still fianna f il and fine gael the descendants respectively of the anti treaty and pro treaty forces of one nine two two until the one nine seven zero s almost all of ireland s prominent politicians were veterans of the civil war a fact which poisoned the relationship between ireland s two biggest parties examples of civil war veterans include eamon de valera frank aiken todd andrews sean lemass republican and w t cosgrave richard mulcahy and kevin o higgins free state moreover many of these men s sons and daughters also became politicians meaning that the personal wounds of the civil war were felt over three generations in the one nine three zero s after fianna fail took power for the first time it looked possible for a while that the civil war might break out again between the ira and the pro free state blueshirts fortunately this crisis was averted and by the one nine five zero s political violence was no longer prominent in southern irish politics w t cosgrave however the breakaway ira continued and continues in various forms to exist up until the one nine eight zero s it still claimed to be the provisional government of the irish republic declared in one nine one eight and annulled by the treaty of one nine two one some people notably michael mcdowell claim that this attitude which dates from the civil war still underpins the politics of the provisional ira footnotes in the one nine nine six film michael collins eamon de valera orders collins death however although de valera was in the area at the time he is not known to have been involved in the assassination whose brother noel a captain in the anti treaty ira was abducted and shot by free state forces in july one nine two three two months after the war had ended his body was dumped in the wicklow mountains near glencree where it was found in october one nine two three the spot where his body was found is marked by a memorial o higgins was the minister for economic affairs in the free state government and was known to be in favour of executions of prisoners his elderly father was killed by republicans during the civil war he was assassinated in one nine two seven by anti treaty ira

support the web standards improvements in html four zero one css two tabbed browsing tab preview and management and web feeds reader features the pop up blocker included in internet explorer six sp two internet explorer has been designed to view the broadest range of web pages and to provide certain features within the operating system including windows update during the heydays of the historic browser wars internet explorer superseded netscape by supporting many of the progressive features of the time component architecture the component object model com technology is used extensively in internet explorer it allows third parties to add functionalities via browser helper objects bho and allows websites to offer rich content via activex as these objects have the same privileges as the browser itself in certain situations this raised concern over security this issue was addressed in internet explorer six zero service pack two which provides an add on manager for controlling activex controls and browser helper objects internet explorer seven provides a no add ons version under programs accessories system tools to address this issue as well usability and accessibility tabbed browsing in internet explorer seven beta two preview since it is tightly integrated with the operating system internet explorer makes use of the accessibility framework provided in windows internet explorer is also a user interface for ftp with operations similar to that of windows explorer the ability to block popup windows was introduced with internet explorer six zero service pack two tabbed browsing can be added to internet explorer six by installing microsoft s msn search toolbar and is natively supported as of internet explorer seven security framework internet explorer uses a zone based security framework which means that sites are grouped based upon certain conditions it allows the restriction of broad areas of functionality and also allows specific functions to be restricted patches and updates to the browser are released periodically and made available through windows update website although security patches continue to be released for a range of platforms most recent feature additions and security improvements are released for windows xp only a report in april two zero zero five showed that only two four of corporate pcs had upgraded to xp sp two internet explorer six service pack two provide download monitoring and install monitoring that user can choose to download or not to download and choose to install or not to install applications executables and installations this prevents installation of spywares adwares viruses or malwares standards support internet explorer almost fully supports html four zero one css level one xml one zero and dom level one with minor implementation gaps it partially supports css level two and dom level two with some implementation gaps and conformance issues it supports xhtml one zero to the extent that html four zero one compatibility guidelines are followed internet explorer uses doctype sniffing to choose between quirks mode renders similarly to older versions of msie and standards mode renders closer to w three c s specifications for html and css rendering it fully supports xslt one zero or the december one nine nine eight working draft of xsl depending on the version of msxml a dynamic link library available it also provides its own dialect of ecmascript called jscript proprietary extensions internet explorer has introduced an array of proprietary extensions to many of the standards including html css and the dom this has resulted in a number of web pages that can only be viewed properly using internet explorer many view this as an example of what is called embrace extend and extinguish eee a way to drive competitors out of business by forcing them to use proprietary technology that a company controls resulting in vendor lock in netscape navigator up to version four seven was also responsible for massive proprietary extension of the core web standards but was not criticized for it as much version seven zero internet explorer seven s quick tabs version seven zero of internet explorer has been renamed to windows internet explorer as part of microsoft s rationalization of component names that are included with windows set to ship with windows vista and as a separate download for windows xp with service pack two and windows server two zero zero three service pack one large amounts of the underlying architecture including the rendering engine and security framework have been completely overhauled partly as a result of these security enhancements the browser will be a stand alone application rather than integrated with the windows shell and it will no longer be capable of acting as a file browser the windows vista version will incorporate additional security measures most significantly protected mode whereby the browser runs in a sandbox with even lower rights than a limited user account software as such it can write to only the temporary internet files folder and can not install start up programs or change any configuration of the operating system this is expected to increase the security of the system considerably on january three one st two zero zero six microsoft released a public preview build beta two preview pre beta two version of internet explorer seven for windows xp service pack two not for windows server two zero zero three sp one on their web site it stated that more public preview builds possibly beta two in april of internet explorer seven will be released in first half of two zero zero six and final version will be released in second half of two zero zero six new features internet explorer seven s web feed reader version seven supports tabbed browsing which has been a popular feature in competing web browsers for some time in addition to this there is a feature called quick tabs which displays a thumbnail preview of opened tabs treating tabs like expos treats application windows with this new feature user can find open close and refresh opened tabs easily a search box has been added to the top right corner to do fast searches using a search engine msn search is the default but additional providers may be added microsoft provides a list of common providers but any web site can identify itself as having a search capability long awaited support for per pixel alpha channel transparency in png images has been added feed reader integration in web feeds support is built in version seven zero the feed reader is fully integrated with the browser so that user can read web feeds rss or atom without an rss reader it also discovers web feeds automatically updates to web feeds can be retrieved when the web browser isn t running the web feeds feature set is also available to third party developers through api s so that the list of subscribed feeds as well as their current contents can be used activex opt in blocks activex control unless it allowed to be installed this feature improves security from unverificable and vulnerable controls activex controls can be chosen to be installed on information bar user can turn on and off activex contol by using add on manager a number of improvements to css support have been made microsoft s stated goal with version seven was to fix the most significant bugs and areas which caused the most trouble for developers and then improved coverage of the standards would come later the well known problem of having the right hand portion of a web page cut off when the page is printed has been fixed page content can also be shrunk to fit more text on a single page the revamped print preview interface will also let users drag the page margins around and see the results immediately a zoom selector has been added to the bottom right corner of the user interface unlike the text size feature this will zoom the complete contents of the web page allowing for easier reading on larger displays fonts are rendered at higher resolution cleartype can be enabled or disabled separately from the rest of the operating system the new phishing filter offers protection against phishing scams and other web sites that may be considered dangerous for a user to enter their personal information into when enabled every web site the user visits is checked against a master list of known phishing sites if a site is listed the user is informed in light of the privacy implications of this feature it is not enabled automatically the user is asked when they start internet explorer seven if they want it enabled microsoft is working in conjunction with companies that specialize in identifying phishing schemes to ensure the list of known sites is accurate and quickly updated address bar and status bar appear in all windows including pop up which helps to block malicious sites from disguising them as trusted sites also the address bar features a color code to visually indicate the trustworthiness of the page the address bar turns red when a page with invalid security certificate is accessed in case of sistes not using any encryption the address bar is white and if the page uses high security certificate the bar turns green criticisms internet explorer is subject to a relatively high volume of criticism much of this criticism is related to concerns about security a notable portion of the widespread promulgation of spam spyware adware and computer viruses across the internet is known to be facilitated by exploitable bugs and flaws in the security architecture of internet explorer furthermore a notable number of users and security experts have pointed out that microsoft has not been sufficiently committed to fixing the browser s exploitable bugs in a timely manner and has been ineffective in pushing those changes out to users several companies maintain databases of security vulnerabilities known to exist in internet explorer and for which no fixes have been published by microsoft as of june two zero zero five there were between two zero and two seven such vulnerabilities reported in internet explorer six for windows xp sp two and one four six in internet explorer six for windows two zero zero zero sp four other criticisms mostly coming from technically proficient users and developers of websites and browser based software applications concern internet explorer s support of open standards internet explorer supports to some degree a number of standardized technologies but has implementation gaps and conformance failures some minor some not that have led to criticism from an increasing number of developers the increase is attributable in large part to the fact that competing browsers that offer relatively thorough standards compliant implementations are becoming more widely used internet explorer s ubiquity in spite of its perceived inferiority in this area frustrates developers who want to write standards compliant cross browser code market adoption usage share the adoption rate of internet explorer seems to be closely related to that of microsoft windows as it is the default web browser that comes with windows since the integration of internet explorer three zero with windows nine five osr two in late one nine nine six the adoption was greatly accelerated from below two zero in one nine nine six to about four zero in one nine nine eight and over eight zero in two zero zero zero this effect however has recently been dubbed the microsoft monoculture by analogy to the problems associated with lack of biodiversity in an ecosystem by two zero zero two internet explorer had almost completely superseded its main rival netscape and dominated the market after having fought and won the browser wars of the late one nine nine zero s internet explorer began to see its usage share shrink having attained a peak of about nine six in two zero zero two it has since been in a steady decline statistics indicate the current most significant competition comes from gecko based browsers in particular mozilla firefox nevertheless internet explorer remains the dominant web browser with a usage share of around eight five based on statistics reference in united states it s relatively high in asia and much lower in europe for instance the share is around nine three in japan and around seven zero in germany industry adoption activex is used by many public websites and web applications including ebay similarly bhos are also used by many search engine companies and third parties for creating add ons that access their services for example search engine toolbars because of the use of com it is possible to include web browsing functionality in third party applications hence there are a number of internet explorer shells and a number of applications like realplayer a media player also use internet explorer s web browsing module for viewing the world wide web within the applications standalone internet explorer while it is not officially possible to keep multiple versions of internet explorer on the same machine some hackers joe maddalone ryan parman et al successfully separated several versions of internet explorer making them standalone applications these were referred as standalone ies and included versions three zero to five five sp two multiple ies in windows web design the web developer joe maddalone who found the solution skyzyx com standalone internet explorer the web developer ryan parman who made the customized browsers files available multiple explorers downloads of all the versions microsoft has discontinued standalone installers for internet explorer to the general public however a blogger web developer programmer named liew cheon fong has posted a procedure for downloading the complete install package standalone install procedure for ie six sp one be aware that unlike previous standalone versions of ie running ie seven in standalone alongside a normal installation of ie six may cause severe problems when using ie six thereafter owing to the insertion of at least one registry key some users have been unable to fix the resulting problems once ie seven has been run it may be unwise to attempt running ie seven in standalone mode if you are not prepared for the possible consequences see jon galloway s script for running ie seven more safely ie seven standalone launch script removal the idea of removing internet explorer from a windows system was first proposed during the united states v microsoft case critics felt that users should have the right to uninstall internet explorer freely just like any other application software one of microsoft s arguments during the trial was that removing internet explorer from windows may result in system instability an australian computer scientist shane brooks demonstrated that windows nine eight could in fact run with ie files removed brooks went on to develop software designed to customize windows versions by removing undesired components which is known as nine eight lite he later created xplite to support nt based operating systems both of these pieces of software can remove ie after the installation of the operating system there are a few popular methods for removing ie from a copy of the windows install disc so it never touches the user s hard drive a method developed by fred vorck involves the manual removal of ie from installation discs nlite on the other hand is an automated program that allows users to exclude ie and many other windows components from installation as desired it is also not possible to run microsoft s windows update with any other browser because of its use of activex therefore removing internet explorer will cause this to stop working footnotes sv one stands for security version one referring to the set of security enhancements made for that release this version of internet explorer is more popularly known as ie six sp two given that it is included with windows xp service pack two but this can lead to confusion when discussing windows server two

for example the stack pointer the instruction pointer index registers or a status word register that acted like a flag for example in comparison operations just like the eight zero eight six the processor also included four one six bit segment registers that enabled the addressing of more than six four kbytes of memory which is the limit of a one six bit architecture by introducing an offset value that was added after being shifted left four bits to the value of another register this addressing system provided a total of one mbyte of addressable memory a value that at the time was

stations of the network broadcast the use of multicasts and broadcasts reduce network traffic when the same information needs to be propagated to all stations of the network however the type one service provides no guarantees regarding the order of the received frames compared to the order in which they have been sent the sender does not even get an acknowledgment that the frames have been

amphibians birds and mammals lamarck divided these animals into two groups the insecta and the vermes but nowadays they are classified into over three zero phyla from simple organisms such as sponges and flatworms to complex animals such as arthropods and mollusks since invertebrates include all animals except a certain group invertebrates form a paraphyletic group but despite not forming a natural group that is monophyletic invertebrate is still a widely used term it is not uncommon for books entitled invertebrate zoology to be found this reflects the bias in society and also in zoology towards larger more complex animals that are more closely related to humans thus there are relatively many scientists studying and relatively much funding available for the study of birds mammals reptiles and so on but far fewer scientists studying invertebrates even though invertebrates include nine seven of all animal species for a full list of animals considered to be invertebrates see animal all the listed phyla are invertebrates along with two of the three subphyla in phylum chordata urochordata and cephalochordata these two plus all the other known invertebrates have only one

was born at sen in rsta then rsten in the district of sunnm re on the west coast of norway his father a small peasant farmer named ivar jonsson died in one eight two six he was brought up to farmwork but he assiduously cultivated all his leisure in reading and when he was eighteen he opened an elementary school in his native parish in one eight three three he entered the household of h c thoresen the husband of the eminent writer magdalene thoresen in her y then her and there he picked up the elements of latin gradually and by dint of infinite patience and concentration the young peasant became master of many languages and began the scientific study of their structure about one eight four one he had freed himself from all the burden of manual labour and could occupy his thoughts with the dialect of his native district sunnm re his first publication was a small collection of folk songs in the sunnm re dialect one eight four three his remarkable abilities now attracted general attention and he was helped to continue his studies undisturbed his grammar of the norwegian dialects one eight four eight was the result of much labour and of journeys taken to every part of the country aasen s famous dictionary of the norwegian dialects appeared in its original form in one eight five zero and from this publication dates all the wide cultivation of the popular language in norwegian since aasen really did no less than construct out of the different materials at his disposal a popular language or definite folke maal people s language for norway with certain modifications the most important of which were introduced later by aasen himself but also through a latter policy aiming to merge this norwegian language with dano norwegian this language has become nynorsk new norwegian the second of norway s two official languages the other being bokm l the dano norwegian descendant of the danish language used in norway at aasen s time an unofficial variety of norwegian more close to aasen s language is still found in h gnorsk high norwegian aasen composed poems and plays in the composite dialect to show how it should be used one of these dramas the heir one eight five five was frequently acted and may be considered as the pioneer of all the abundant dialect literature of the last half century of the one eight zero zero s from vinje to garborg aasen continued to enlarge and improve his grammars and his dictionary he lived very quietly in lodgings in oslo then christiania surrounded by his books and shrinking from publicity but his name grew into wide political favour as his ideas about the language of the peasants became more and more the watch word of the popular party quite early in his career in one eight four two he had begun to receive a stipend to enable him to give his entire attention to his philological investigations and the storting norwegian parliament conscious of the national importance of his work treated him in this respect with more and more generosity as he advanced in years he continued his investigations to the last but it may be said that after the one eight seven three edition of his dictionary he added but little to his stores aasen holds perhaps an isolated place in literary history as the one man who has invented or at least selected and constructed a language which has pleased so many thousands of his countrymen that they have accepted it for their schools their sermons and their songs he died in christiania on september two three one eight nine six and was buried with public honours ivar aasen

irredentism is an international relations term that involves advocating annexation of territories administered by another state on the grounds of common ethnicity and or prior historical possession actual or alleged it is a feature of identity politics and cultural and political geography since most borders have been moved and redrawn at one point a great many countries could theoretically present irredentist claims to their neighbours however some countries are the subject of potential irredentism from birth many of africa s borders were artificially imposed by european colonial powers the result split ethnic groups between different countries such as the igbo who are divided between nigeria cameroon and equatorial guinea an area that may be subjected to a potential claim is therefore sometimes called an irredenta not all potential irredentas are involved in actual irredentism origins the word was coined in italy from the phrase italia irredenta unredeemed italy this originally referred to austro hungarian rule over mostly or partly italian inhabited territories in the northern adriatic such as trentino and trieste during the one nine th and early two zero th century today pakistan refers to the part of kashmir controlled by its own forces as redeemed or liberated using the name azad kashmir meaning free kashmir a common way to express a claim to adjacent territories on the grounds of historical or ethnic association is by using the epithet greater before the country name as in greater israel greater serbia greater albania or greater morocco this conveys the image of national territory at its maximum conceivable extent with the country proper at its core e g serbia proper irredentist disputes not all territorial disputes are irredentist although they are often couched in irredentist rhetoric to justify and legitimize such claims both internationally and within the country prominent irredentist disputes during the past century have included gabriele d annunzio s occupation of fiume now rijeka from one nine one nine one nine two one the original irredentist dispute when the term was first popularized mutual counterclaims between the people s republic of china and the republic of china to territories currently controlled by the other the people s republic of china claims to the islands of taiwan penghu matsu kinmen and orchid island collectively ruled by the government of the republic of china taiwan arunachal pradesh under indian administration are also claimed by prc as part of tibet although china s similar claims to nepal and bhutan have been dropped china s ongoing occupation of tibet is also seen as irredentist as also its rearrangement of tibetan provincial boundaries the republic of china s claims to tannu uriankhai now a republic of russia outer mongolia i e the independent country of mongolia mainland china ruled by the people s republic of china and most of the prc s territorial claims claims among mexicans to the southwestern united states purchased by the united states from mexico in the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo after the mexican american war for a sum of one five million dollars an amount

hungarians including parts of slovakia romania serbia and montenegro ukraine etc the claim is based on historic criteria for some regions such as transylvania where hungarians are a minority and ethnic for other regions romanian irredentists before world war one claimed the unification of areas where romanians formed a majority into the national romanian state the goal was achieved in one nine one eight but bessarabia was lost again in one nine four zero being transformed into the soviet republic of moldova more recently the goal of romanian irredentism is the unification of romania with the republic of moldova serbian claims to large areas of bosnia and croatia on grounds of ethnic affiliation bosniak claims to sandzak albanian claims to kosovo and to parts of macedonia and greece on grounds of ethnic affiliation the soviet union annexed parts of finnish karelia after world war ii this question of the status of ceded karelia was revived in finland after the end of cold war iraqi claims to kuwait before the gulf war morocco s claims initiated in one nine six three by king hassan ii to a claimed greater morocco an area comprising parts of algeria western sahara

independence leading to annexation of thessaly a failed war against turkey in one eight nine seven and the balkan wars after world war i greece claimed what is now the aegean coastline of turkey because of the predominence there of greek speakers since antiquity and former rule by the byzantine empire other greek irredentist claims under the greater greece policy called megali idea included south albania north epirus and cyprus japan s kuril islands dispute with the former soviet union now russia most recently over the loss of the southern four islands in the kuril islands chain in the closing days of world war ii under the treaty of san francisco the ainu a people indigenous to japan had been the sole inhabitants of the islands for thousands of years until ethnic russians ukrainians and byelorussians began to settle there and displace them triadic nexus of irredenta conflict in his one nine nine six book nationalism reframed rogers brubaker outlined a pattern to describe a common theme of irredentist conflict referred to as the triadic nexus in this view irredenta conflict is a conflict between three parties a nationalizing state a national movement representing an ethnic minority within that state and an external national homeland to which that minority is construed as ethnically belonging brubaker s triadic nexus is a visual representation of this granting each party a corner of the triangle the implication is that the national minority is caught between the nationalizing state within whose borders it exists and the external homeland to which it is seen as belonging constitutional irredentism some states formalize their irredentist claims by including them in their constitutional documents argentina part iii section one of the constitution of the argentine nation states that the argentine nation ratifies its legitimate and non prescribing sovereignty over the malvinas south georgia and south sandwich islands and over the corresponding maritime and insular zones as they are an integral part of the national territory the recovery of said territories and the full exercise of sovereignty respectful of the way of life of their inhabitants and according to the principles of international law are a permanent and unrelinquished goal of the argentine people section three five mentions that the argentine nation is the

is traditionally spoken across the north american arctic and to some extent in the subarctic in labrador it was also to some degree spoken in far eastern russia particularly the diomede islands but is almost certainly extinct in russia today the inuit live primarily in three countries greenland an autonomous province of denmark canada and the american state of alaska the total population of inuit speaking their traditional language is difficult to assess with precision since most counts rely on self reported census data that may not accurately reflect usage or competence greenland census estimates place the number of speakers of inuit dialects there at roughly five zero zero zero zero while canadian estimates are at roughly three zero zero zero zero these two countries count the bulk of speakers of inuit language variants as usage in alaska is increasingly moribund roughly three zero zero zero alaskans speak inuit dialects out of a population of over one three zero zero zero inuit and the language is almost certainly extinct in russia in addition an estimated seven zero zero zero greenlandic inuit live in european denmark but this is the largest group outside of canada and greenland so the global population of speakers of inuit language variants is on the order of nine zero zero zero zero people what is the inuit language called the traditional language of the inuit is a system of closely interrelated dialects that are not readily comprehensible from one end of the inuit world to the other and some people do not think of it as a single language but rather as a group of languages however there are no clear criteria for breaking the inuit language into specific member tongues since it forms a continuum of close dialects each band of inuit understands its neighbours and most likely their neighbours neighbours but at some remove comprehensibility drops to a very low level as a result inuit in different places use different words for their own variants and for the entire group of languages and this ambiguity has been carried into other languages creating a great deal of confusion over what labels should be applied to it in greenland the official form of inuit language and one of the official languages of the state is called kalaallisut in other languages it is often called greenlandic or some cognate term however neither the words kallaalisut nor greenlandic are generally used to refer to the variants of canada or alaska in alaska the language is called inupiatun but the variants of the seward peninsula are distinguished from the other alaskan variants by calling them qawiaraq or for some dialects bering straits inupiatun in canada the word inuktitut is routinely used to refer to all canadian variants of the inuit traditional language and it is under that name that it is recognised as one of the official languages of nunavut and the northwest territories however one of the variants of western nunavut is called inuinnaqtun to distinguish itself from the dialects of eastern canada while the variants of the northwest territories are sometimes called inuvialuktun and have in the past sometimes been called inuktun in those dialects the name is sometimes rendered as inuktitun to reflect dialectical differences in pronunciation the inuit language of quebec is called inuttitut by its speakers and often by other people but this is a minor variation in pronunciation in labrador the language is called inuttut or often in official documents by the more descriptive name labradorimiutut furthermore canadians both inuit and non inuit sometimes use the word inuktitut to refer to all of the inuit language variants including those of alaska and greenland the phrase inuit language is largely limited to professional discourse since in each area there is one or more conventional terms that cover all the local variants or it is used as a descriptive term in publications where readers can t necessarily be expected to know the locally used words but this means that while you can call the french language french you cannot call the inuit language inuit saying peter speaks inuit is a very strange usage that most people who are familiar with the inuit language would recognise as suspect comparable to asserting that hispanics must speak hispanic the word inuit is generally reserved for the ethnic group both from its inuit language meaning it refers specifically to a group of people and in the way the word has been adopted in english although many people refer to the inuit language as eskimo language this is an ambiguous term that can also include yupik see eskimo aleut languages and is in addition strongly discouraged in canada and diminishing in usage elsewhere see the article on eskimo for more information on this word classification and history the language of the inuit is an eskimo aleut language it is fairly closely related to the yupik languages and more remotely to the aleut languages these cousin languages are all spoken in western alaska and eastern chukotka russia it is not discernibly related to other north american or northwest asian indigenous languages although some have proposed that it is related to indo european languages as part of the hypothetical nostratic superphylum and there are those who consider it a paleo siberian language although that is more a geographic than a linguistic grouping early forms of the inuit language were spoken by the thule people who overran the dorset civilisation which had previously occupied arctic america at the beginning of the second millennium by one three zero zero the inuit and their language had reached western greenland and finally east greenland roughly at the same time the viking colony in southern greenland disappeared it is generally believed that it was during this centuries long eastwards migration that the inuit language became distinct from the yupik languages spoken in western alaska and chukotka until one nine zero two an enclave of dorset people or sadlermiut in modern inuktitut spelling sallirmiut existed on southampton island almost nothing is known about their language but the few eyewitness accounts tell of them speaking a strange dialect this suggests that they also spoke an eskimo aleut language but one quite distinct from the forms spoken in canada today the yupik and inuit languages are very similar syntactically and morphologically their common origin can be seen in a number of cognates the western alaskan variants retain a large number of features present in proto inuit language and in yup ik enough so that they might be classed as yup ik languages if they were viewed in isolation from the larger inuit world geographic distribution and variants distribution of inuit language variants across the arctic the inuit language is a fairly closely linked set of dialects which can be broken up using a number of different criteria traditionally inuit describe dialect differences by means of place names to describe local idiosyncracies in language the dialect of iglulik versus the dialect of iqaluit for example however political and sociological divisions are increasingly the principal criteria for describing different variants of the inuit language because of their links to different writing systems literary traditions schools media sources and borrowed vocabulary this makes any partition of the inuit language somewhat problematic this article will use labels that try to synthesise linguistic sociolinguistic and political considerations in splitting up the inuit dialect spectrum this scheme is not the only one used or necessarily one used by inuit themselves but its labels do try to reflect the usages most seen in popular and technical literature in addition to the territories listed below some seven zero zero zero greenlandic speakers are reported to live in mainland denmark and according to the two zero zero one census roughly two zero zero self reported inuktitut native speakers regularly live in parts of canada which are outside of traditional inuit lands alaska see inupiatun and qawiaraq for more information of the roughly one three zero zero zero alaskan inupiat as few as three zero zero zero may still be able to speak inuit language variants with most of them over the age of four zero alaskan inuit speak at least two fairly distinct dialects qawiaraq is spoken on the southern side of the seward peninsula and the norton sound area it was also in the past spoken in chukotka particularly big diomede island but appears to have vanished in russian areas through assimilation into yupik chukchi and russian speaking communities it is radically different in phonology from other inuit language variants some people consider the bering strait dialect to be separate from qawariaq inupiatun is spoken in north slope and the kotzebue sound area the variants of the kotzebue sound area and the northwest of alaska are sometimes called malimiutun or malimiut inupiatun however despite significant differences in phonology malimiutun is readily comprehensible to other alaskan inupiat canada see inuktitut for more information the inuit language is an official language in the northwest territories the official and dominant language of nunavut enjoys a high level of official support in nunavik a semi autonomus portion of quebec and is still spoken in some parts of labrador generally canadians refer to all dialects spoken in canada as inuktitut but the terms inuvialuktun inuinnaqtun and labradorimiutut have some currency in referring to the variants of specific areas greenland see kalaallisut for more information greenland counts approximately five zero zero zero zero speakers of inuit language variants of whom over nine zero speak west greenlandic dialects at home kalaallisut or in english greenlandic is the name given to the standard dialect and official language of greenland this standard national language is now taught to all greenlanders in school regardless of their native dialect it reflects almost exclusively the language of western greenland and has borrowed a great deal of vocabulary from danish while canadian and alaskan inuit language variants have tended to take vocabulary from english or sometimes french and russian it is written using the roman alphabet the dialect of the upernavik area in northwest greenland is somewhat different in phonology from the standard dialect tunumiit oraasiat or tunumiisut in kalaallisut often east greenlandic in other languages is the dialect of eastern greenland it differs sharply from other inuit language variants and has roughly three zero zero zero speakers according to ethnologue avanersuaq is the dialect of the area around qaanaaq in northern greenland it is sometimes called the thule dialect or north greenlandic this area is the northernmost settlement area of the inuit and has a relatively small number of speakers it is reputed to be fairly close to the north baffin dialect since a group of migratory inuit from baffin island settled in the area during the one nine th and early two zero th centuries it counts under one zero zero zero speakers according to ethnologue phonology and phonetics see main article inuit language phonology and phonetics eastern canadian inuit language variants have fifteen consonants and three vowels which can be long or short consonants are arranged with five places of articulation bilabial alveolar palatal velar and uvular and three manners of articulation voiceless stops voiced continuants and nasals as well as two additional sounds voiceless fricatives the alaskan dialects have an additional manner of articulation the retroflex which was present in proto inuit language retroflexes have disappeared in all the canadian and greenlandic dialects except for the phoneme in natsilingmiutut which derives from a former retroflex almost all inuit language variants have only three basic vowels and make a phonological distinction between short and long forms of all vowels the only exceptions are at the extreme edges of the inuit world parts of greenland and in western alaska morphology and syntax see inuit language morphology and syntax for a more detailed description specific to nunavut inuktitut the inuit language like other eskimo aleut languages has a very rich morphological system in which a succession of different morphemes are added to root words like verb endings in foreign european languages to indicate things that in languages like english would require serveral words to express see also agglutinative language and polysynthetic language all inuit language words begin with a root morpheme to which other morphemes are suffixed the language has hundreds of distinct suffixes in some dialects as many as seven zero zero fortunately for the learners the language has a highly regular morphology although the rules are sometimes very complicated they do not have exceptions in the sense that english and other indo european languages do this system makes words very long and potentially unique for example in central nunavut inuktitut tusaatsiarunnanngittualuujunga i can t hear very well this long word is composed of a root word tusaa to hear followed by five suffixes tsiaq well junnaq be able to nngit not tualuu very much junga one st pers singular present indicative non specific this sort of word construction is pervasive in inuit language and makes it very unlike english in one large canadian corpus the nunavut hansard nine two of all words appear only once in contrast to a small percentage in most english corpora of similar size this makes the application of zipf s law quite difficult in the inuit language furthermore the notion of a part of speech can be somewhat complicated in the inuit language fully inflected verbs can be interpreted as nouns the word ilisaijuq can be interpreted as a fully inflected verb he studies but can also be interpreted as a noun student that said the meaning is probably obvious to a fluent speaker when put in context the morphology and syntax of the inuit language vary to some degree between dialects and the article inuit language morphology and syntax describes primarily central nunavut dialects but the basic principles will generally apply to all of them and to some degree to yupik as well vocabulary toponymy and names exotic as traditional inuit names sound both the names of places and people tend to be highly prosaic when translated iqaluit for example is simply the plural of the noun iqaluk fish iglulik simply means place with houses a word that could be interpreted as simply town inuvik is place of people baffin island qikiqtaaluk in inuit language approximately translates to big island although practically all inuit have legal names based on southern naming traditions at home and among themselves they still use native naming traditions there too names tend to consist of highly prosaic words the inuit traditionally believed that by adopting the name of a dead person or a class of things they could take some of their characteristics or powers and enjoy a part of their identity this is why they were always very willing to accept european names they believed that this made them equal to the europeans common native names in canada include ujaraq rock nuvuk headland nasak hat or hood tupiq tent and qajaq kayak inuit also use animal names traditionally believing that by using those names they took on some of the characteristics of that animal nanuq polar bear uqalik arctic hare and tiriaq ermine are favourites in other cases inuit are named after dead people or people in traditional tales by naming them after anatomical traits those people are believed to have had examples include itigaituk has no feet usuiituk has no penis and tulimak rib inuit may have any number of names given by parents and other community members words for snow see a more thorough discussion at eskimo words for snow a popular belief exists that the inuit have an unusually large number of words for snow this is not accurate and results from a misunderstanding of the nature of polysynthetic languages in fact the inuit have only a few base roots for snow qanniq qanik in some dialects which is used most often like the verb to snow and aput which means snow as a substance parts of speech work very differently in the inuit language than in english so these definitions are somewhat misleading the inuit language can form very long words by adding more and more descriptive affixes to words those affixes may modify the syntactic and semantic properties of the base word or may add qualifiers to it in much the same way that english uses adjectives or prepositional phrases to qualify nouns eg falling snow blowing snow snow on the ground snow drift etc the fact that there are many inuit words for snow has been put forward so often it is somewhat of a journalistic clich as evidenced by a collection of quotes from linguist mark liberman writing because the inuit language is spread over such a large area divided between different nations and political units and originally reached by europeans of different origins at different times there is no uniform way of writing the inuit language most inuktitut in nunavut and nunavik is written using a scheme called inuktitut syllabics based on canadian aboriginal syllabics the western part of nunavut and the northwest territories use a roman alphabet scheme usually identified as inuinnaqtun in alaska another roman scheme is used nunatsiavut uses another variant devised by german speaking moravian missionaries which included the letter kra greenland s roman scheme was originally much like the one used in nunatsiavut but has been reformed and modified in recent years the canadian syllabary see inuktitut syllabics for more information the syllabary used to write inuktitut titirausiq nutaaq the extra characters with the dots represent long vowels in the latin transcription the vowel would be doubled the inuktitut syllabary used in canada is based on the cree syllabary devised by the missionary james evans the present form of the syllabary for canadian inuktitut was adopted by the inuit cultural institute in canada in the one nine seven zero s the inuit in alaska the inuvialuit inuinnaqtun speakers and inuit in greenland and labrador use the roman alphabet although it has been adapted for their use in different ways though conventionally called a syllabary the writing system has been classified by some observers as an abugida since syllables starting with the same consonant have related glyphs rather than unrelated ones

born february two four one three zero four year of death uncertain possibly one three six eight or one three seven seven was born in tangier morocco during the time of merinid sultanate rule in the islamic calendar year seven zero three into a berber family he was a sunni islamic scholar and jurisprudent from the maliki madhhab a school of fiqh or sunni islamic law and at times a qadi or judge however he is best known as an extensive traveller or explorer whose account documents his travels and side excursions over a period of almost thirty years covering some seven three zero zero zero miles one one seven zero zero zero km this journeying covered almost the entirety of the known islamic world extending also to present day india the maldives sri lanka southeast asia and china a distance readily surpassing that of his prior near contemporary and traveller marco polo at the instigation of the sultan of morocco abu inan faris several years after his return ibn battuta dictated an account of his journeys to a scholar named ibn juzayy whom he had met while in granada this account recorded by ibn juzayy and interspersed with the latter s own comments is the primary source of information for his adventures the title of this initial manuscript may be translated as a gift to those who contemplate the wonders of cities and the marvels of travelling but is often simply referred to as the rihla or journey whilst apparently fictional in places the rihla still gives as complete an account as exists of some parts of the world in the one four th century almost all that is known about ibn battuta s life comes from one source ibn battuta himself via ibn juzayy in places the things he claims he saw or did are probably fanciful but in many others there is no way to know whether he is reporting or story telling the following account assumes the latter where it is not obviously the former the hajj with detours born in tangier morocco some time between one three zero four and one three zero seven at the age of approximately twenty ibn battuta went on a hajj a pilgrimage to mecca once done however he continued travelling eventually covering about seven five zero zero zero miles over the length and breadth of the muslim world and beyond about four four modern countries batutta started his journeys in one three two five his journey to mecca was by land and followed the north african coast of the maghreb region quite closely until he reached cairo at this point he was within mameluk territory which was relatively safe and he embarked on the first of his detours three commonly used routes existed to mecca and ibn battuta chose the least travelled a journey up the nile then east by land to the red sea port of aydhad however upon approaching that city he was forced to turn back due to a local rebellion returning to cairo he took a second side trip to damascus then also controlled by the mameluks having encountered a holy man during his first trip who prophesied that ibn battuta would only reach mecca after a journey through syria an additional advantage to the side journey was that other holy places were along the route hebron jerusalem and bethlehem for example and the mameluke authorities put special effort into keeping the journey safe for pilgrims after spending ramadan in damascus ibn battuta joined up with a caravan travelling the eight zero zero miles from damascus to medina burial place of muhammad after four days he then journeyed on to mecca there he completed the usual rituals of a muslim pilgrim and having graduated to the status of al hajji as a result now faced his return home upon reflection he decided to continue journeying instead his next destination was the il khanate in modern day iraq and iran to iran and the silk roads once again hooking up with a caravan he crossed the border into mesopotamia and visited al najaf the burial place of the fourth caliph ali from there he journeyed to basra then isfahan which was only a few decades away from being nearly destroyed by timur next were shiraz and baghdad the latter of which was in bad shape after being sacked by hulagu khan there he met abu sa id the last ruler of the unified il khanate ibn battuta travelled with the royal caravan for a while then turned north to tabriz on the silk road the first major city in the region to open its gates to the mongols it had become an important trading centre after most of its nearby rivals were razed second hajj and east africa after this trip ibn battuta returned to mecca for a second hajj and lived there for a year before embarking on a second great trek this time down the red sea and the eastern african coast his first major stop was aden where his intention was to make his fortune as a trader of the goods that flowed into the arabian peninsula from around the indian ocean before doing so however he determined to have one last adventure and signed on for a trip down the coast of africa spending about a week in each of his destinations he visited ethiopia mogadishu mombasa zanzibar and kilwa among others with the change of the monsoon he and the ship he was aboard then returned to south arabia having completed his final adventure before settling down he then immediately decided to go visit oman and the straits of hormuz this done he journeyed to mecca again turkey and india spending another year there he then resolved to seek employment with the muslim sultan of delhi needing a guide and translator if he was to travel there he went to anatolia then under the control of the seljuk turks to join up with one of the caravans that went from there to india a sea voyage from damascus on a genoese ship landed him in alanya on the southern coast of modern day turkey from there he travelled by land to konya and then sinope on the black sea coast crossing the black sea ibn battuta landed in caffa now theodosia in the crimea and entered the lands of the golden horde there he bought a wagon and fortuitously joined the caravan of ozbeg the golden horde s khan on a journey as far as astrakhan on the volga river upon reaching astrakhan the khan allowed one of his pregnant wives to go give birth back in her home city constantinople it is perhaps of no surprise to the reader that ibn battuta talked his way into this expedition his first beyond the boundaries of the islamic world arriving there towards the end of one three three two he met the emperor andronicus iii and saw the outside of hagia sophia after a month in the city he retraced his route to astrakhan then carried on past the caspian and aral seas to bokhara and samarkand from there he journeyed south to afghanistan the mountain passes of which he used to cross into india the sultanate of delhi was a relatively new addition to dar al islam and sultan muhammed tughlaq had resolved to import as many muslim scholars and other functionaries as possible to consolidate his rule on the strength of his years of studies while in mecca ibn battuta was employed as a qadi judge by the sultan tughlaq was erratic even by the standards of the time and ibn battuta veered between living the high life of a trusted subordinate and being under suspicion for a variety of reasons eventually he resolved to leave on the pretext of taking another hajj but the sultan offered the alternative of being ambassador to china given the opportunity to both get away from the sultan and visit new lands ibn battuta took it southeast asia and china en route to the coast he and his party were attacked by hindus and separated from the others he was robbed and nearly lost his life nevertheless he managed to catch up with his group within two days and continued the journey to cambay from there they sailed to calicut while ibn battuta visited a mosque on shore however a storm blew up and two of the ships of his expedition were sunk the third then sailed away without him and ended up seized by a local king in a kingdom of samudra aceh province of sumatra a few months later local myth says he was the one who always referred to the kingdom of samudra but pronounced in a way that sounded more like the modern day sumatra which then became the name of the whole island previously the island was called andalas fearful of returning to delhi as a failure he stayed for a time in the south under the protection of jamal al din but when that worthy was overthrown it became necessary for ibn battuta to leave india altogether he resolved to carry on to china with a detour near the beginning of the journey to the maldives in the maldives he spent nine months much more time than he had intended to as a qadi his skills were highly desirable in the backwards islands and he was half bribed half kidnapped into staying appointed chief judge and marrying into the royal family he became embroiled in local politics and ended up leaving after wearing out his welcome by imposing strict judgments in the laissez faire island kingdom from there he carried on to ceylon for a visit to sri pada adam s peak setting sail from ceylon his ship nearly sank in a storm then the ship that rescued him was attacked by pirates stranded on shore ibn battuta once again worked his way back to calicut from where he then sailed to the maldives again before getting onboard a chinese junk and trying once again to get to china this time he succeeded reaching in quick succession chittagong sumatra vietnam and then finally quanzhou in fujian province china from there he went north to hangzhou not far from modern day shanghai he also travelled even further north through the grand canal to beijing although there has been some doubt about whether this actually occurred return home and the black death returning to quanzhou ibn battuta decided to return home though exactly where home was was a bit of a problem returning to calicut once again he pondered throwing himself on the mercy of muhammed tughlaq but thought better of it and decided to carry on to mecca once again returning via hormuz and the il khanate he saw that state dissolved into civil war abu sa id having died since his previous trip there returning to damascus with the intention of retracing the route of his first hajj he learned that his father had died death was the theme of the next year or so for the black death had begun and ibn battuta was on hand as it spread through syria palestine and arabia after reaching mecca he decided to return to morocco nearly a quarter century after leaving it during the trip he made one last detour to sardinia then returned to tangier to discover that his mother had also died a few months before andalus and north africa having settled in tangier for all of a few days ibn battuta then set out for a trip to al andalus muslim spain alfonso xi of castile was threatening the conquest of gibraltar and ibn battuta joined up with a group of muslims leaving tangier with the intention of defending the port by the time he arrived the black death had killed alfonso and the threat had receded so ibn battuta decided to visit for pleasure instead he travelled through valencia and ended up in granada leaving spain he decided to travel through one of the few parts of the muslim world that he had never explored morocco on his return home he stopped for a while in marrakesh which was nearly a ghost town after the recent plague and the transfer of the capital to fez once more he returned to tangier and once more he moved on two years before his own first visit to cairo the malian king mansa musa had passed through the same city on his own hajj and had caused a sensation with his extravagant riches west africa contained vast quantities of gold previously unknown to the rest of the world while ibn battuta never mentions this specifically hearing of this during his own trip must have planted a seed in his mind for he decided to set out and visit the muslim kingdom on the far side of the sahara desert mali in the fall of one three five one ibn battuta set out from fez reaching the last moroccan town sijilmasa a bit more than a week later when the winter caravans began a few months later he joined one and within a month he was in the central saharan town of taghaza a centre of the salt trade taghaza was awash with salt and malian gold though ibn battuta did not have a favorable impression of the place another five zero zero miles through the worst part of the desert brought him to mali particularly the town of walata from there he travelled southwest along a river he believed to be the nile it was actually the niger river until he reached the capital of the mali empire there he met mansa suleyman king since one three four one dubious about the miserly hospitality of the king he nevertheless stayed for eight months before journeying back up the niger to timbuktu though in the next two centuries it would become the most important city in the region at the time it was small and unimpressive and ibn battuta soon moved on partway through his journey back across the desert he received a message from the sultan of morocco commanding him to return home this he did and this time it lasted after the publication of the rihla little is known about ibn battuta s life he may have been appointed a qadi in morocco ibn battuta died in morocco some time between one three six eight and one three seven seven for centuries his book was obscure even within the muslim world but in the one eight zero zero s it was rediscovered and translated into several european languages since then ibn battuta has grown in fame and is now a well known figure in the middle east see also ibn battuta crater for the lunar crater named after him ibn battuta shopping

rautaesirippu in finnish is a western term referring to the boundary which symbolically ideologically and physically divided europe into two separate areas from the end of world war ii until the end of the cold war roughly one nine four five to one nine nine zero a variant of the iron curtain the bamboo curtain was coined in reference to the people s republic of china as the standoff between the west and the countries of the iron and bamboo curtains eased with the end of the cold war the term fell out of any but historical usage political economic and military realities east of the iron curtain iron curtain germany while the iron curtain was in place certain countries of eastern europe and many in central europe except west germany liechtenstein switzerland and austria were under the political influence of the soviet union indeed the central european states to the east of the curtain were frequently regarded as being part of eastern europe rather than central europe many of the states were members of the soviet union itself the soviet socialist republics while with two exceptions the neighboring countries of the eastern bloc were ruled by pro soviet governments kept in place by the threat of military force the two exceptions were yugoslavia which retained its full independence and albania which escaped soviet influence in the one nine six zero s and aligned itself with china both albania and yugoslavia were communist states to the east of the iron curtain the states developed their own international economic and military alliances comecon and the warsaw pact many people tried to escape the soviets rule west of the iron curtain to the west of the iron curtain the countries of western europe and southern europe along with austria west germany liechtenstein and switzerland operated market economies with the exception of a period of fascism in spain and portugal and military dictatorship in greece these countries were ruled by democratic governments most states to the west of the iron curtain with the exception of neutral switzerland liechtenstein austria sweden finland and ireland were allied with the united states within nato economically the european community and the european free trade association were the western counterparts to comecon the iron curtain as a physical entity in the summer of one nine eight nine the foreign ministers of austria and hungary alois mock and gyula horn ceremonially cut through the border defences separating their countries the iron curtain took physical form in the shape of border defences between the countries of the western and eastern blocs these were some of the most heavily militarised areas in the world particularly the so called inner german border commonly known simply as die grenze in german between east and west germany the inner german border was marked in rural areas by double fences made of steel mesh with sharp edges while near urban areas a high concrete barrier similar to the berlin wall was built the barrier was always a short distance inside east german territory to avoid any intrusion into western territory the actual borderline was marked by posts and signs and was overlooked by numerous watchtowers set behind the barrier in some places a death strip was constructed on the east german side of the barrier in which unauthorized access would be met with bullets the strip of land on the west german side of the barrier between the actual borderline and the barrier was readily accessible but only at considerable personal risk as it was patrolled by both east and west german border guards shooting incidents were not uncommon and a total of two eight east german border guards were killed between one nine four eight one nine eight nine some may have been victims of friendly fire by their own side for more on this topic see the gdr border system article elsewhere the border defences between west and east were much lighter the border between hungary and neutral austria for instance was marked by a simple chain link fence which was easily removed when it became the first part of the iron curtain to be dismantled in one nine eight nine the abandon of this strip of land created a wildlife corridor across europe that helped the spread of several species to new territories the term iron curtain was only used for the fortified borders in central europe it was never used for similar borders in asia between communist and capitalist states the border between north korea and south korea is very comparable to the former inner german border particularly in its degree of militarisation but it has never conventionally been considered part of the iron curtain origins of the iron curtain winston churchill popularized the term iron curtain the first recorded use of the term iron curtain was in one eight one nine in the general sense of an impenetrable barrier by one nine two zero it had become associated with the boundary of the soviet union s sphere of influence it was used during world war ii by german propaganda minister joseph goebbels and later count lutz schwerin von krosigk in the last days of the war however its use was popularized by the former british leader winston churchill who used it in his sinews of peace address march five one nine four six from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the continent behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of central and eastern europe warsaw berlin prague vienna budapest belgrade bucharest and sofia all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what i must call the soviet sphere and all are subject in one form or another not only to soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from moscow churchill made his speech at westminster college in fulton missouri after its fall a section of the berlin wall was transported to and erected at westminster college although the phrase was not well received at the time as the cold war strengthened it gained popularity as a short hand reference to the division of europe the iron curtain served to keep people in and information out and the metaphor eventually enjoyed wide acceptance in the west in the soviet union the speech was seen by stalin as reinforcing his view that a future conflict with the west was inevitable over the following months through a mixture of persuasion and purges of those holding contrary views the soviet union did indeed come to see the west as a threat rather than the ally they had been during world war ii the cold war had begun in earnest antagonism between east and west the antagonism between the soviet union and the west that led to churchill s speech had various origins britain france japan canada the united states and many other countries had backed the white russians against the bolsheviks during the one nine one eight one nine two zero russian civil war and the fact hadn t been forgotten by the soviets in the build up to world war ii and in the face of the western appeasement of hitler the soviets signed the molotov ribbentrop pact with nazi germany one of the intentions being to divide the border states between them to form a buffer zone following the war stalin was determined to acquire a similar buffer against germany with pro soviet states on its border leading to strained relations at the yalta conference february one nine four five and the subsequent potsdam conference august one nine four five in the west there was not only opposition to soviet domination over the buffer states but the fear grew that the soviets were building an empire that might be a threat to them and their interests and in particular churchill was concerned that the united states might return to its pre war isolationism leaving the exhausted european states unable to resist soviet demands president franklin d roosevelt had announced at yalta that after the defeat of germany us forces would be withdrawn from europe within two years antony beevor berlin the downfall one nine four five p eight zero see also cold war one nine four seven one nine five three and its origins earlier usages of the term there are various earlier usages of the term iron curtain pre dating churchill some suggest the term may have first been coined by queen elisabeth of the belgians one after world war i to describe the political situation between belgium and germany in one nine one four an iron curtain or eisener vorhang was an obligatory precaution in all german theaters to prevent the possibility of fire from spreading from the stage to the rest of the theater such fires were rather common as the decor often was very flammable in case of fire a metal wall would separate the stage from the theater secluding the flames to be extinguished by firefighters douglas reed used this metaphor in his book disgrace abounding jonathan cape one nine three nine page one two nine the bitter strife in yugoslavia between serb unionists and croat federalists had only been hidden by the iron safety curtain of the king s dictatorship on february two five one nine four five joseph goebbels wrote of an iron curtain in his weekly newspaper das reich if the german people lay down their weapons the soviets according to the agreement between roosevelt churchill and stalin would occupy all of east and southeast europe along with the greater part of the reich an iron curtain ein eiserner vorhang would fall over this enormous territory controlled by the soviet union behind which nations would be slaughtered the jewish press in london and new york would probably still be applauding the year two zero zero zero the first oral mention of an iron curtain was in a broadcast by count lutz schwerin von krosigk to the german people on may two one nine four five in the east the iron curtain behind which unseen by the eyes of the world the work of destruction goes on is moving steadily forward the first recorded occasion on which churchill used the term iron curtain was in a may one two one nine four five telegram he sent to us president harry s truman i am profoundly concerned about the european situation three an iron curtain is drawn down upon their front we do not know what is going on behind there seems little doubt that the whole of the regions east of l beck trieste corfu will soon be completely in their hands to this must be added the further enormous area conquered by the american armies between eisenach and the elbe which will i suppose in a few weeks be occupied when the americans retreat by the russian power all kinds of arrangements will have to be made by general eisenhower to prevent another immense flight of the german

repeated the words in a further telegram to truman on june four one nine four five in which he protested against such a us retreat to what was earlier designated as and ultimately became the us occupation zone saying the military withdrawal would bring soviet power into the heart of western europe and the descent of an iron curtain between us and everything to the eastward ibid p nine two at

cold war cold war speeches metaphors integrated services digital network isdn is a type of circuit switched telephone network system designed to allow digital transmission of voice and data over ordinary telephone copper wires resulting in better quality and higher speeds than available with analog systems more broadly isdn is a set of protocols for establishing and breaking circuit switched connections and for advanced call features for the user the english term is a backronym thought better for english language advertisements than the original integriertes sprach und datennetz german for integrated voice and data net in a videoconference isdn provides simultaneous voice video and text transmission between individual desktop videoconferencing systems and group room videoconferencing systems configurations in isdn there are two types of channels b for bearer and d for delta b channels are used for data which may include voice and d channels are intended for signalling and control but can also be used for data there are two kinds of access to isdn basic rate interface bri also basic rate access bra consists of two b channels each with bandwidth of six four kbit s and one d channel with a bandwidth of one six kbit s together these three channels can be designated as two b d primary rate interface pri also primary rate access pra contains a greater number of b channels and a d channel with a bandwidth of six four kbit s the number of b channels for pri varies according to the nation in north america and japan it is two three b one d with an aggregate bit rate of one five four four mbit s t one in europe and australia it is three zero b one d with an aggregate bit rate of two zero four eight mbit s e one using a variation of the alternate mark inversion encoding technique call data is transmitted over the data b channels with the signalling d channels used for call setup and management once a call is set up there is a simple six four kbit s synchronous bidirectional data channel between the end parties lasting until the call is terminated there can be as many calls as there are data channels to the same or different end points bearer channels may also be multiplexed into what may be considered single higher bandwidth channels via a process called b channel bonding the d channel can also be used for sending and receiving x two five data packets and connection to x two five packet network this is specified in x three one in practice x three one was only commercially implemented in france and japan reference points a set of reference points are defined in the isdn standard to refer to certain points between the telco and the end user isdn equipment r defines the point between a non isdn device and a terminal adapter ta which provides translation to and from such a device s defines the point between the isdn equipment or ta and a network termination type two nt two device t defines the point between the nt two and nt one devices one u defines the point between the nt one and the telco switch two one most nt one devices can perform the functions of the nt two as well and so the s and t reference points are generally collapsed into the s t reference point two inside north america the nt one device is considered customer premises equipment and must be maintained by the customer thus the u interface is provided to the customer in other locations the nt one device is maintained by the telco and the s t interface is provided to the customer types of communications handled among the kinds of data that can be moved over the six four kbit s channels are pulse code modulated voice calls providing access to the traditional voice pstn this information can be passed between the network and the user end point at call set up time in north america isdn is nowadays mostly used as an alternative to analog connection most commonly for internet access some of the services envisaged as being delivered over isdn are now delivered over the internet instead in europe and in germany in particular isdn has been successfully marketed as a phone with features as opposed to a pots phone plain old telephone service with few or no features however meanwhile features that were first available with isdn such as three way call call forwarding caller id etc are now commonly available for ordinary analog phones as well eliminating this advantage of isdn another advantage of isdn was the possibility of multiple simultaneous calls one call per b channel e g for big families but with the increased popularity and reduced prices of mobile telephony this has become less interesting as well making isdn rather unappealing to the private customer where an analog connection requires a modem an isdn connection requires a terminal adapter ta a sample isdn call the following is an example of a primary rate pri isdn call showing the q nine two one lapd and the q nine three one network message intermixed i e exactly what was exchanged on the d channel the call is originating from the switch where the trace was taken and goes out to some other switch possibly an end office lec who terminates the call the first line format is if the message is an isdn level message then a decoding of the message is attempted showing the various information elements that make up the message all isdn messages are tagged with an id number relative to the switch that started the call local remote following this optional decoding is a dump of the bytes of the message in format the rr messages at the beginning prior to the call are the keep alive messages then you will see a setup message that starts the call each message is acknowledged by the other side with a rr one zero four nine four seven

genomic imprinting is the phenomenon whereby a small subset of all the genes in the genome are expressed according to their parent of origin some imprinted genes are expressed from a maternally inherited chromosome and silenced on the paternal chromosome while other imprinted genes show the opposite expression pattern and are only expressed from a paternally inherited chromosome contrary to expectation imprints can act as a silencer or an activator for imprinted genes normally a healthy child inherits two sets of chromosomes one from the mother and one from the father a living child this applies to all mammals cannot be produced when both sets of chromosomes come from the same parent because imprinted gene expression will be unbalanced because of the way imprints work a fetus that has two maternal sets of chromosomes will have twice the normal level of some imprinted genes and completely lack expression of other imprinted genes no naturally occurring cases of parthenogenesis exist in mammals because of imprinted genes experimental manipulation of a paternal methylation imprint controlling the igf two gene has however recently allowed the creation of rare individual mice with two maternal sets of chromosomes but this is not a true parthenogenote a process known as reprogramming occurs in the parent female or male when the egg or sperm is maturing in many instances this is achieved through methylation of the dna of genes or regulatory sequences which results in the gene not being expressed in other instances phosphorylation or other chemical modification of histone proteins appears to lead to silencing imprinting is known to cause problems in cloning with clones having dna that is not methylated in the right places some scientists think this is due to there not being enough time for reprogramming to be properly achieved when a nucleus is added to an egg during somatic cell nuclear transfer the egg starts dividing in minutes as compared to the days or months it takes for reprogramming during embryonic development if time is the responsible factor it may be possible to delay cell division in clones giving time for proper reprogramming to occur several genetic diseases that map to one five q one three locus three of section one of the long arm of chromosome one five in humans are due to abnormal imprinting the prader willi syndrome is due to two copies of the chromosome one five being inherited from the mother and the locus is imprinted the angelman syndrome gene is due to two copies of the chromosome one five inherited from the father and the locus is similarly imprinted thus someone who inherits both chromosomes one five from one parent called uniparental disomy has prader willi or angelman syndrome depending on which parent they come from but more common is the deletion of the region one five q one three and when this deletion is inherited depending on from whom the affected person gets this deletion from the disease varies if it s the mother who transfers the deletion then the child will have angelman syndrome and if it s the father who gives the deletion then the child will get prader willi syndrome an allele of the callipyge from the greek for beautiful buttocks or clpg gene in sheep produces large buttocks consisting of muscle with very little fat the large buttocked phenotype only occurs when the allele is present on the copy of chromosome one eight inherited from a sheep s father and is not on the copy of chromosome one eight inherited from that sheep s mother molecular genetics gene expression

that was created on september one eight one nine nine eight in order to oversee a number of internet related tasks previously performed directly on behalf of the u s government by other organizations notably iana the tasks of icann include managing the assignment of domain names and ip addresses to date much of its work has concerned the introduction of new generic top level domains the technical work of icann is referred to as the iana function the rest of icann is mostly about defining policy paul twomey is the president ceo of icann since march two seven two zero zero three vint cerf is currently chairman of the icann board of trustees icann procedures icann holds its periodic public meetings for the expressed purpose of staying in touch with its membership critics note that the locations of these meetings are often in countries with disproportionally small internet access and far away from locations that the majority of the internet using public can afford to reach thus making public input or participation less likely supporters reply that icann has a worldwide remit and a key part of its mission is to build internet use where it is weak at present icann is formally organized as a public benefit non profit corporation in california icann was set up in california due to the presence of jon postel who was a founder of icann and was set to be its first cto prior to his untimely death icann remains in the same building where jon postel worked in the marina del rey california location of the information sciences institute at the university of southern california resolutions of the icann board preliminary reports and minutes of the meetings are published for the public to view on the icann website notable events in icann history the original mandate for icann came from the united states government spanning two presidential administrations bill clinton and george w bush on january three zero one nine nine eight the national telecommunications and information administration ntia an agency of the us department of commerce issued for comment a proposal to improve the technical management of internet names and addresses the proposed rulemaking or green paper was published in the federal register on february two zero one nine nine eight providing opportunity for public comment ntia received more than six five zero comments as of march two three one nine nine eight when the comment period closed the green paper proposed certain actions designed to privatize the management of internet names and addresses in a manner that allows for the development of robust competition and facilitates global participation in internet management the green paper proposed for discussion a variety of issues relating to dns management including private sector creation of a new not for profit corporation the new corporation managed by a globally and functionally representative board of directors icann was formed in response to this policy the iana function currently exists under a remit from the u s department of commerce on march one four two zero zero two in a public meeting in accra in ghana icann decided to reduce direct public at large participation one of a few publicly elected board members karl auerbach sued icann in superior court in california in order to see accounting records the records were ultimately released to the public in august two zero zero two in september and october two zero zero three icann played a crucial role in the conflict over verisign and its wildcard dns service site finder after an open letter from icann issuing an ultimatum to verisign the company voluntarily shut down the service on october four two zero zero three following this step verisign filed a lawsuit against icann on february two seven two zero zero four claiming that icann had overstepped its authority seeking through the suit to reduce ambiguity over icann s authority the anti trust component of verisign s claim was dismissed in august two zero zero four verisign s broader challenge that icann overstepped its contractual rights is currently outstanding although a proposed settlement would drop verisign s challenge to icann in exchange for the right to increase pricing on com domains at the meeting of icann in rome taking place from march two to march six two zero zero four icann agreed to ask approval of the us department of commerce for the waiting list service of verisign on one seven may two zero zero four icann published a proposed budget for the year two zero zero four zero five it included proposals to increase the openness and professionalism of its operations and greatly increased its proposed spending from us eight two seven m to one five eight three m the increase was to be funded by the introduction of new top level domains charges to all domain registries and a fee for all domain name registrations renewals and transfers initially two zero us for all domains within a country code top level domain and two five for all others the council of european national top level domain registries centr which represents the internet registries of three nine countries has rejected the increase accusing icann of a lack of financial prudence and criticising what it describes as icann s unrealistic political and operational targets despite the criticism the registry agreement for the top level domains jobs and travel includes a us two fee on every domain the licensed companies sell or renew along with the successful negotiations of the travel and jobs namespace xxx mobi and cat

information society in tunisia in november two zero zero five agreed not to get involved in the day to day and technical operations of icann however it also agreed to set up an international internet governance forum with a consultative role on the future governance of the internet icann s government adivsory committee or gac is currently set up to provide advice to icann regarding public policy issues and has participation by many of the world s governments arguments about icann some of icann s critics would like to see it internationalize itself meaning that it would be reconstituted as some kind of public sector entity under international law and would cancel its contractual links to the u s government and the u s department of commerce which are historical in origin of the one five

approximations to the solution starting from an initial guess this approach is in contrast to direct methods which attempt to solve the problem in one shot like solving a linear system of equations ax b by finding the inverse of the matrix a iterative methods are useful for problems involving a large number of variables sometimes of the order of millions where direct methods would be prohibitively expensive and in some cases impossible even with the best available computing power newton s method one of the most familiar iterative methods is usually taught in one st year calculus newton s method attractive fixed points if an equation can be put into the form f x x and a solution x is an attractive fixed point of the function f then one may begin with a point x one in the basin of attraction of x and let x n one f x n for n one and the sequence n one will converge to the solution x linear systems in the case of a linear system the two main classes of iterative methods are the stationary iterative methods and the more general krylov subspace methods stationary iterative methods stationary iterative methods solve a linear system with an operator approximating the original one and based on a measurement of the error the residual form a correction equation for which this process is repeated while these methods are simple to derive implement and analyse convergence is only guaranteed for a limited class of matrices krylov subspace methods krylov subspace methods form an orthogonal basis of the sequence of successive matrix powers times the initial residual the krylov sequence the approximations to the solution are then formed by minimizing the residual over the subspace formed the prototypical method in this class is the conjugate gradient method convergence since these methods form a basis it is evident that the method converges in n iterations where n is the system size however in the presence of rounding errors this statement does not hold moreover in practice n can be very large and the iterative process reaches sufficient accuracy already far earlier the analysis of these methods is hard depending on a complicated function of the spectrum of the operator preconditioners the approximating operator that appears in stationary iterative methods can also be incorporated in krylov subspace methods alternatively preconditioned krylov methods can be considered as accelerations of stationary iterative methods where they become transformations of the original operator to a presumably better conditioned one the construction of preconditioners is a large research area history probably the first iterative method appeared in a letter of gauss to a student of his he proposed solving a four by four system of equations by repeatedly solving the component in which the residual was the largest the theory of stationary iterative methods was solidly established with the work of d m young starting in the one nine five zero s the conjugate gradient method was also invented in the one nine five zero s with independent developments by cornelius lanczos magnus hestenes and eduard stiefel but its nature and applicability were misunderstood at the time only in the one nine seven zero s was it realized that conjugacy based methods work very well for partial differential equations especially the elliptic type external links templates for

warfare itself the international prize court was an international court proposed at the beginning of the two zero th century to hear prize cases an international agreement to create it the convention relative to the creation of an international prize court was made at the hague on october one eight one nine zero seven the international prize court was to hear appeals from national courts concerning prize cases it was later modified by the additional protocol to the convention relative to the creation of an international prize court done at the hague on october one eight one nine one zero however neither the convention nor the subsequent protocol ever entered into force since none of the signatories ever ratified it and the court never came into existence the convention was opposed particularly by elements within the united states and the united kingdom as a violation of national sovereignty it was innovative for the time in being both the first ever treaty for a truly international court as opposed to a mere arbitral tribunal and in providing individuals with access to the court going against the prevailing doctrines of international law at the time according to which only states had rights and duties under international law the protocol was an attempt to resolve some concerns expressed by the united states at the court who felt it to be in violation of its constitution which provided for its supreme court to have the final judicial authority a number of ideas from the international prize court can be seen in present day international courts such as its provision for judges ad hoc later adopted in the permanent court of international justice now the international court of justice prize warfare imam arabic persian is an arabic word meaning leader the ruler of a country might be called the imam for example however the capitalized term or the imam arabic has important connotations in the islamic tradition especially in shia beliefs toc prayer leader the common everyday use of the word is for a person leading muslim congregational prayers salah in this meaning the imam is not required to be a cleric clerical imams shia imams in the shia context imam has a meaning more central to belief the shia believe that the imam is someone who is able to lead mankind in all aspects of life in addition they believe that an imam is a perfect example in everything according to shia an imam is a leader that must be followed since he is appointed by allah god the shia interpretation is that the quran clearly says that only god can appoint an imam and no one else has the power to designate one the incident of ghadeer e khum is referenced as when muhammad declared ali as the leader of the community after him according to the twelve imam shiite imam is a divine status like prophethood a prophet can also be an imam but not all prophets are imams since prophet muhammad is the last prophet there could be no prophets after him and so the one two imams are not prophets but only imams these one two imams are as great in a sense as all the previous prophets except prophet muhammed who is the greatest of all following is a listing of the rightful successors of muhammad as recognized by twelver shias each imam was the son of the previous imam except for husayn who was the brother of hasan and ali being muhammad s cousin and son in law the shi a

ifr is a set of regulations and procedures for flying aircraft without the assumption that pilots will be able to see and avoid obstacles terrain and other air traffic it is an alternative to visual flight rules vfr where the pilot is primarily or exclusively responsible for see and avoid separation the most important concept of ifr flying is that it allows continued flight operations in reduced visibility during which time the ability of a pilot to physically see and avoid collision with other aircraft or obstacles is severely reduced or even impossible the distance that is achieved when avoiding obstacles or other aircraft is termed separation in controlled airspace air traffic control atc separates ifr aircraft from obstacles and other ifr aircraft by applying separations based on time distance and altitude differences between aircraft by relying either on radar or reports of aircraft positions traditionally sent as voice radio transmissions but increasingly as electronic data exchanges generally in most controlled airspaces ifr aircraft require an atc clearance for each part of the flight typically providing a heading or route altitude and clearance limit the farthest the aircraft can fly without a new clearance in very busy areas typically near major airports clearances may also be required for vfr aircraft and atc may also provide separation between ifr and vfr aircraft or even between vfr aircraft in uncontrolled airspace ifr aircraft do not require clearances and they separate themselves from each other by using charted minimum altitudes to avoid terrain and obstacles standard cruising altitudes to avoid aircraft flying in different directions and radio reports over mandatory locations in the united states and canada all airspace from one eight zero zero zero to six zero zero zero zero feet five five eight six to one eight two eight eight meters is designated as class a requiring all aircraft to operate under ifr weather one advantage of ifr is the ability to fly an aircraft in instrument meteorological conditions imc weather conditions that do not meet the minimum visibility requirements for vfr in such conditions the pilot will control the attitude of the aircraft by watching the flight instruments and will rely entirely on atc for separation though large airliners and increasingly smaller aircraft now carry their own terrain and collision avoidance systems such as tcas it is important however not to confuse ifr with imc the vast majority of ifr flying is done under visual meteorological conditions vmc and in many cases the pilot will be controlling the aircraft primarily by outside visual references as with vfr under vmc in some types of airspace atc will not provide separation between ifr and vfr aircraft in fact in areas with limited radar coverage atc may not know the location of vfr aircraft so pilots are responsible for seeing and avoiding other traffic just as they would be under vfr the pilot will usually navigate by using electronic navigation equipment and in areas of radar coverage by receiving vectors compass headings assigned by atc while weather conditions can be worse than those allowed for vfr flight there are still minimum conditions that must be present in order for the aircraft to take off or land these will vary according to the type of electronic navigation aids available the location and height of terrain and obstructions in the vicinity of the airport and according to qualifications of the crew and aircraft procedures there are three stages to an ifr flight departure en route and approach for each stage there are standard published procedures to allow ifr aircraft to move in a safe orderly way from the moment the wheels leave the runway to the moment they touch down again these procedures also allow an ifr aircraft to complete a flight predictably in the case of lost communications with atc lost comms with default altitudes and headings for every stage departures are described by simple departure procedures dp normally providing an initial heading and altitude or for busier airports by standard instrument departures sid providing more detailed instructions often accompanied by diagrams or charts en route flight is described by ifr charts showing navigation aids fixes and standard routes called airways with minimum safe altitudes for each segment approaches are described by terminal procedures often called approach plates describing a series of steps and segments to make the transition from en route flight to a position where the aircraft can complete a landing visually often from a low altitude and close to the airport all instrument approaches have minimum altitudes if it is not possible to complete a landing visually from the specified altitude decision height and location the pilot must commence a missed approach and return to en route flight busy airports may also have standard terminal arrivals stars providing an additional connection between en route flight and the final approach qualifications to fly under ifr a pilot must have an instrument rating and must meet recency of experience requirements in the united states these recency of experience requirements include six instrument approaches navaid intercepting and tracking and holding procedures in the past six months the aircraft must also be equipped and type certified for instrument flight the uk differs from pilot licensing practice in the u s in the uk any pilot can decide to which flight rules he adheres given that the meteorological conditions for those rules are met the pilot does need an instrument rating to fly in instrument meteorological conditions and under ifr in controlled airspace the upshot of this is that non instrument qualified pilots can elect to fly under ifr in visual meteorological conditions outside controlled airspace compared to the rest of the world the uk s flight crew licensing regime is somewhat unusual in this

info nfo and dagbladet information information as a concept bears a diversity of meanings from everyday usage to technical settings generally speaking the concept of information is closely related to notions of communication constraint control data form instruction knowledge meaning mental stimulus pattern perception and representation many people speak about the information age as the advent of the knowledge age or knowledge society the information society and information technologies and even though information science and computer science are often in the spotlight the word information is often used without careful consideration of the various meanings it has acquired information as a message information is the state of a system of interest curiosity message is the information materialized information is a message from a sender to one or more receivers if information is viewed in this manner it does not have to be accurate it may be a truth or a lie or just the sound of a kiss even a disruptive noise used to inhibit the flow of communication and create misunderstanding would in this view be a form of information this model assumes there is a definite sender and at least one receiver many refinements of the model assume the existence of a common language understood by the sender and at least one of the receivers an important variation identifies information as that which would be communicated by a message if it was sent from a sender to a receiver capable of understanding the message however in requiring the existence of a definite sender the information as a message model does not attach any significance to the idea that information is something that can be extracted from an environment e g through observation reading or measurement measuring information the view of information as a message came into prominence with the publication in one nine four eight of an influential paper by claude shannon a mathematical theory of communication this paper provides the foundations of information theory and endows the word information not only with a technical meaning but also a measure if the sending device is equally likely to send any one of a set of n messages then the preferred measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set is the base two logarithm of n this measure is called self information in this paper shannon continues the choice of a logarithmic base corresponds to the choice of a unit for measuring information if the base two is used the resulting units may be called binary digits or more briefly bits a word suggested by j w tukey a device with two stable positions such as a relay or a flip flop circuit can store one bit of information n such devices can store n bits the bell system technical journal vol two seven p three seven nine july one nine four eight a complementary way of measuring information is provided by algorithmic information theory in brief this measures the information content of a list of symbols based on how predictable they are or more specifically how easy it is to generate the list the sequence below would have a very low algorithmic information measurement since it is a very predictable pattern and as the pattern continues the measurement would not change shannon information would give the same information measurement for each symbol since they are statistically random and each new symbol would increase the measurement one two three four five six seven eight nine one zero one one one two one three one four one five one six one seven one eight one nine two zero two one it is important to recognise the limitations of shannon s work from the perspective of human meaning when referring to the meaning content of a message shannon noted frequently the messages have meaning these semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem the significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages emphasis in original in information theory signals are part of a process not a substance they do something they do not contain any specific meaning combining algorithmic information theory and information theory we can conclude that the most random signal contains the most information as it can be interpreted in any way and cannot be compressed micheal reddy noted that signals of the mathematical theory are patterns that can be exchanged there is no message contained in the signal the signals covey the ability to select from a set of possible messages in information theory the system must be designed to operate for each possible selection not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design see also lexicographic information cost information as a pattern information is any represented pattern this view assumes neither accuracy nor directly communicating parties but instead assumes a separation between an object and its representation as well as the involvement of someone capable of understanding this relationship this view seems therefore to require a conscious mind consider the following example economic statistics represent an economy however inaccurately what are commonly referred to as data in computing statistics and other fields are forms of information in this sense the electro magnetic patterns in a computer network and connected devices are related to something other than the pattern itself such as text to be displayed and keyboard input signals signs and symbols are also in this category on the other hand according to semiotics data is symbols with certain syntax and information is data with a certain semantic painting and drawing contain information to the extent that they represent something such as an assortment of objects on a table a profile or a landscape in other words when a pattern of something is transposed to a pattern of something else the latter is information this type of information still assumes some involvement of conscious mind of either the entity constructing the representation or the entity interpreting it if you accept that information can be defined merely as a pattern does it not follow that neither utility nor meaning are necessary components of information surely a distinction must be made between raw unprocessed data and information which possesses utility value or some quantum of meaning information may indeed be characterised as a pattern it is a necessary condition but not sufficient for example a telephone book follows a specific pattern name address telephone number an individual entry does not become informative in some sense unless and until it possesses some degree of utility value or meaning for example someone might look up a girlfriend s number might order a take away etc the vast majority of numbers will never be construed as information in any meaningful sense the gap between data and information is only closed by a behavioural bridge whereby some value utility or meaning is added to transform mere data or pattern into information when one constructs a representation of an object one can selectively extract from the object sampling or use a system of signs to replace encoding or both the sampling and encoding result in representation an example of the former is a sample of a product an example of the latter is verbal description of a product both contain information of the product however inaccurate when one interprets representation one can predict a broader pattern from a limited number of observations inference or understand the relation between patterns of two different things decoding one example of the former is to sip a soup to know if it is spoiled an example of the latter is examining footprints to determine the animal and its condition in both cases information sources are not constructed or presented by some sender of information to repeat information in this sense does not assume direct communication but it assumes involvement of some conscious mind regardless information is dependent upon but usually unrelated to and separate from the medium or media used to express it in other words the position of a theoretical series of bits or even the output once interpreted by a computer or similar device is unimportant except when someone or something is present to interpret the information therefore a quantity of information is totally distinct from its medium information as sensory input often information is viewed as a type of input to an organism or designed device inputs are of two kinds some inputs are important to the function of the organism for example food or device energy by themselves in his book sensory ecology dusenbery called these causal inputs other inputs information are important only because they are associated with causal inputs and can be used to predict the occurrence of a causal input at a later time and perhaps another place some information is important because of association with other information but eventually there must be a connection to a causal input in practice information is usually carried by weak stimuli that must be detected by specialized sensory systems and amplified by energy inputs before they can be functional to the organism or device for example light is often a causal input to plants but provides information to animals the colored light reflected from a flower is too weak to do much photosynthetic work but the visual system of the bee detects it and the bee s nervous system uses the information to guide the bee to the flower where the bee often finds nectar or pollen which are causal inputs serving a nutritional function information is any type of sensory input when an organism with a nervous system receives an input it transforms the input into an electrical signal this is regarded information by some the idea of representation is still relevant but in a slightly different manner that is while abstract painting does not represent anything concretely when the viewer sees the painting it is nevertheless transformed into electrical signals that create a representation of the painting defined this way information does not have to be related to truth communication or representation of an object entertainment in general is not intended to be informative music the performing arts amusement parks works of fiction and so on are thus forms of information in this sense but they are not forms of information according to the previous definitions above consider another example food supplies both nutrition and taste for those who eat it if information is equated to sensory input then nutrition is not information but taste is information as an influence which leads to a transformation information is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns in this sense there is no need for a conscious mind to perceive much less appreciate the pattern consider for example dna the sequence of nucleotides is a pattern that influences the formation and development of an organism without any need for a conscious mind systems theory at times seems to refer to information in this sense assuming information does not necessarily involve any conscious mind and patterns circulating due to feedback in the system can be called information in other words it can be said that information in this sense is something potentially perceived as representation though not created or presented for that purpose when marshall mcluhan speaks of media and their effects on human cultures he refers to the structure of artifacts that in turn shape our behaviors and mindsets also pheromones are often said to be information in this sense in two zero zero three j d bekenstein claimed there is a growing trend in physics to define the physical world as being made of information itself and thus information is defined in this way see the section below on information as a property in physics also see gregory bateson information as a property in physics main article physical information information has a well defined meaning in physics examples of this include the phenomenon of quantum entanglement where particles can interact without reference to their separation or the speed of light information itself cannot travel faster than light even if the information is transmitted indirectly this could lead to the fact that all attempts at physically observing a particle with an entangled relationship to another are slowed down even though the particles are not connected in any other way other than by the information they carry another link is demonstrated by the maxwell s demon thought experiment in this experiment a direct relationship between information and another physical property entropy is demonstrated a consequence is that it is impossible to destroy information without increasing the entropy of a system in practical terms this often means generating heat thus in the study of logic gates the theoretical lower bound of thermal energy released by an and gate is more than for the not gate because information is destroyed in an and gate and simply converted in an not gate physical information is of particular importance in the theory of quantum computers etymology according to the oxford english dictionary the earliest historical meaning of the word information in english was the act of informing or giving form or shape to the mind as in education instruction or training a quote from one three eight seven five books come down from heaven for information of mankind it was also used for an item of training e g a particular instruction melibee had heard the great skills and reasons of dame prudence and her wise informations and techniques one three eight six the english word was apparently derived by adding the common noun of action ending ation descended through french from latin tio to the earlier verb to inform in the sense of to give form to the mind to discipline instruct teach men so wise should go and inform their kings one three three zero inform itself comes via french from the latin verb informare to give form to to form an idea of furthermore latin itself already even contained the word informatio meaning concept or idea but the extent to which this may have influenced the development of the word information in english is unclear as a final note the ancient greek word for form was eidos and this word was famously used in a technical philosophical sense by plato and later aristotle to denote the ideal identity or essence of something see the forms information is not data the words information and data are used interchangeably in many contexts this may lead to their confusion however they are not synonyms often data is defined as raw facts while information is processed data as is the case in most of the article below another distinction that is made is that information is the things that we know and data is the representation of the information as an example we may be thinking about a favorite niece s age who is four we would tend to represent that with arabic numerals four but we could represent it using roman numerals iv tick marks or any other way we agree on the information has not changed in each case although the data has note that we tend to think of information in terms of declarative knowledge that is the facts we know such as a temperature an age etc information can also be skills and things we know how to do which is called procedural knowledge an important consequence of this distinction is that information has meaning i e can inform while data does not computers work with data representations and not information meanings this is why a computer will calculate the average employee number even though it is meaningless note that one person s information may be another s data depending on whether the recipient understand the data or its context also when someone or something such as a computer system is given a fact it may only be data but when they make sense of or interpret it often by bringing it together with other facts it may become information information is usually thought of as in a strict sense a subset of data however sometimes the reverse interpretation can be taken such as describing data as raw information data may also have a more specific sense in some fields e g referring to a certain type or set of information used in that context when used pragmatically in everyday speech it usually specifically refers to collections of numbers or in a wider sense to any content not of relevance or interest to the speaker or not yet understood by the speaker themselves in particular data is unstructured lacks context and may not be relevant to the recipient when data is correctly organized filtered and presented with context it can become information because it then has value to the recipient data which is not information i e has not yet informed or been given a context is often called raw data references bekenstein jacob d two zero zero three august information

placing it between blue and violet like many other colors orange and violet are the most well known it gets its name from an object in the natural world the plant named indigo once used for dyeing cloth see also indigo dye indigo is neither an additive primary color nor a subtractive primary color it was named and defined by isaac newton when he divided up the optical spectrum which is a continuum of frequencies he named seven colors specifically to link them with the known planets days of the week and other lists that had seven items the human eye is relatively insensitive to indigo s frequencies and some otherwise well sighted people cannot distinguish indigo from blue and violet for this reason some commentators including isaac asimov have suggested that indigo should not be regarded as a color in its own right but merely as a shade of blue or violet see also list of colors shades of violet optical spectrum imf redirects here for other meanings of imf see imf disambiguation the logo of the international monetary fund imf the international monetary fund imf is the international organization entrusted with overseeing the global financial system by monitoring exchange rates and balance of payments as well as offering technical and financial assistance when asked organization and purpose the imf describes itself as an organization of one eight four countries working to foster global monetary cooperation secure financial stability facilitate international trade promote high employment and sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty with the exception of north korea cuba liechtenstein andorra monaco tuvalu and nauru all un member states either participate directly in the imf or are represented by other member states in the one nine three zero s as economic activity in the major industrial countries dwindled countries started adopting mercantilist practices attempting to defend their economies by increasing restrictions on imports to conserve dwindling reserves of gold and foreign exchange some countries curtailed foreign imports some devalued their currencies and some introduced complicated restrictions on foreign exchange accounts held by their citizens these measures were arguably detrimental to the countries themselves as the ricardian comparative advantage states that everyone gains from trade without restrictions it is noteworthy to mention that although the size of the pie is enhanced according to this theory of free trade when distributional concerns are taken into account there are always industries that benefit while others lose out world trade declined sharply as did employment and living standards in many countries as world war ii came to a close the leading allied countries considered various plans to restore order to international monetary relations and at the bretton woods conference the imf emerged the founding members drafted a charter or articles of agreement of an international institution to oversee the international monetary system and to promote both the elimination of exchange restrictions relating to trade in goods and services and the stability of exchange rates the imf came into existence in december one nine four five when the first two nine countries signed its articles of agreement the statutory purposes of the imf today are the same as when they were formulated in one nine four four see box two from the end of world war ii until the late one nine seven zero s the capitalist world experienced unprecedented growth in real incomes since then china s integration into the capitalist system has added substantially to the growth of the system within the capitalist system the benefits of growth have not flowed equally to all either within or among nations but most capitalist countries have seen recent increases in prosperity that contrast starkly with the conditions within capitalist countries during the interwar period the lack of a recurring global depression is likely due to improvements in the conduct of international economic policies that have encouraged the growth of international trade and helped smooth the economic cycle of boom and bust in the decades since world war ii apart from rising prosperity the world economy and monetary system have undergone other major changes that have increased the importance and relevance of the purposes served by the imf but that has also required the imf to adapt and reform rapid advances in technology and communications have contributed to the increasing international integration of markets and to closer linkages among national economies as a result financial crises when they erupt now tend to spread more rapidly among countries the imf s influence in the global economy steadily increased as it accumulated more members the number of imf member countries has more than quadrupled from the four four states involved in its establishment reflecting in particular the attainment of political independence by many developing countries and more recently the collapse of the soviet bloc the expansion of the imf s membership together with the changes in the world economy have required the imf to adapt in a variety of ways to continue serving its purposes effectively history agreement for the creation of the international monetary fund came at the united nations monetary and financial conference in bretton woods new hampshire united states on july two two one nine four four the principal architects of the imf at the conference were british economist john maynard keynes and the chief international economist at the us treasury department harry dexter white the articles of agreement came into force on december two seven one nine four five the organization came into existence on may one one nine four six as part of a post wwii reconstruction plan and it began financial operations on march one one nine four seven it is sometimes referred to as a bretton woods institution along with the international bank for reconstruction and development now part of the larger world bank group membership qualifications a country may apply for membership of the imf the application will be considered first by the imf s executive board after its consideration the executive board will submit a report to the board of governors of the imf with recommendations in the form of a membership resolution these recommendations cover the amount of quota in the imf the form of payment of the subscription and other customary terms and conditions of membership after the board of governors has adopted the membership resolution the applicant state needs to take the legal steps required under its own law to enable it to sign the imf s articles of agreement and to fulfill the obligations of imf membership a member s quota in the imf determines the amount of its subscription its voting weight its access to imf financing and its allocation of sdrs assistance and reforms part of its mission has become to provide assistance to countries that experience serious economic difficulties member states with balance of payments problems may request loans and or organizational management of their national economies in return the countries are obliged to launch certain reforms an example of which is the washington consensus criticism the role of the two bretton woods institutions has been controversial to many since the late cold war period critics claim that imf policy makers deliberately supported capitalistic military dictatorships friendly to american and european corporations critics also claim that the imf is generally apathetic or hostile to their views of democracy human rights and labor rights these criticisms generated a controversy that helped spark the anti globalization movement others claim the imf has little power to democratize sovereign states nor is that its stated objective to advise and promote financial stability arguments in favor of the imf say that economic stability is a precursor to democracy two criticisms from economists have been that financial aid is always bound to so called conditionalities including structural adjustment programs conditionalities it is claimed retard social stability and hence inhibit the stated goals of the imf typically the imf and its supporters advocate a keynesian approach as such adherents of supply side economics generally find themselves in open disagreement with the imf the imf frequently advocates currency devaluation criticized by proponents of supply side economics as inflationary secondly they link higher taxes under austerity programmes with economic contraction currency devaluation is recommended by the imf to the governments of poor nations with struggling economies supply side economists claim these keynesian imf policies are destructive to economic prosperity although many other economists disagree complaints are also directed toward international monetary fund gold reserve being undervalued at its inception in one nine four five the imf pegged gold at three five dollars per troy ounce of gold in one nine seven three the nixon administration lifted the fixed asset value of gold in favour of a world market price hence the fixed exchange rates of currencies tied to gold were switched to a floating rate also based on market price and exchange this largely came about because petrodollars outside the united states were more than could be backed by the gold at fort knox under the fixed exchange rate system the fixed rate system only served to limit the amount of assistance the organization could use to help debt ridden countries that said the imf sometimes advocates austerity programmes increasing taxes even when the economy is weak in order to generate government revenue and balance budget deficits which is the opposite of keynesian policy these policies were criticised by joseph e stiglitz former chief economist at the world bank in his book globalization and its discontents he argued that by converting to a more monetarist approach the fund no longer had a valid purpose as it was designed to provide funds for countries to carry out keynesian reflations most altermondialists like attac believe that imf interventions aggravate the poverty and debt of third world and developing countries according to the analysis by yves engler the imf is considered to be responsible for worsening or actually creating famine in malawi two zero zero two ethiopia two zero zero three and niger two zero zero five opposition to the imf is often fragmented for instance advocates of supply side economics would generally regard the policies advocated by attac to be little different in form to the ideas peddled by the imf in other words they would see attac tax and spend policies and the imf s austerity policies as being fundamentally similar argentina which had been considered by the imf to be a model country in its compliance to policy proposals by the bretton woods institutions experienced a catastrophic economic crisis in two zero zero one generally believed to have been caused by imf induced budget restrictions which undercut the government s ability to sustain national infrastructure even in crucial areas such as health education and security and privatization of strategically vital national resources the crisis added to widespread hatred of this institution in argentina and other south american countries with many blaming the imf for the region s economic problems the current as of early two zero zero six trend towards moderate left wing governments in the region and a growing concern with the development of a regional economic policy largely independent of big business pressures has been ascribed to this crisis another example of where imf structural adjustment programmes aggravated the problem was in kenya before imf got involved in the country the kenya central bank oversaw all currency movement in and out of the country imf mandated that kenya central bank had to allow easier currency movement however the adjustment resulted in very little foreign investment but allowed kamlesh manusuklal damji pattni with the help of corrupt government officials to syphon out billions of kenya shillings in what came to be known as the goldenberg scandal leaving the country in a state worse than that which it was in before the imf reforms were implemented that the imf intervenes only in countries that experience years of dire economic conditions has certainly hurt its reputation the financial collapses it intervenes in are products of uneven capitalist development sometimes exacerbated by government mismanagement but mismanagement is often cited by rich nations as the source of the financial crises these collapses tend to lead to years of economic difficulty that can be addressed in various ways but imf stuctural adjustment policies consistently serve to open up or liberalize economies to foreign capital rather than provide for economic recovery through statist policies such as government financed projects to achieve full employment thus imf policies further the notion that economic development in underdeveloped countries is dependent on attracting foreign investment rather than through a state managed approach centered on full employment and progressive taxation it is also true that politicians have used the imf as an easy target for blame when they themselves have erred using nationalism to gain easy political points overall the imf success record is limited while it was created to help stabilize the global economy since one nine eight zero over one zero zero countries have experienced a banking collapse that reduced gdp by four percent or more far more than at any previous time in history the considerable delay in imf response to a crisis and the fact that it tends to only respond to rather than prevent them has led many economists to argue for reform whatever the feelings people in the western world have for the imf research by the pew research center shows that more than six zero percent of asians and seven zero percent of africans feel that the imf and the world bank have a positive effect on their country such research has made proponents of imf claim the imf critique misleading as it would be difficult to speak of suffering if the sufferers don t feel hurt the documentary life and debt deals with the imf s policies influence on jamaica and its economy from a critical point of view past managing directors an unwritten rule establishes that the imf s managing director must be european and that the president of the world bank must be from the united states executive directors who confirm the

numbering bank accounts it was originally adopted by the european committee for banking standards and was later adopted as iso one three six one six one nine nine seven the iban consists of a two letter iso three one six six one country code followed by two check digits and up to thirty alphanumeric characters for the domestic bank account number called the bban basic bank account number it is up to each country s national banking community to decide on the length of the bban for accounts in that country but its length must be fixed for any given country a unique identifying code for the bank of a fixed length and at a fixed position is required to be contained in the bban however it is left up to the national banking communities to determine its length and position within the bban so long as it is constant for each country when stored electronically the iban is not to be broken up by spaces but when printed on paper it is to be expressed in groups of four characters with the last group of variable length the iban was developed to help improve the payments system within the european union customers especially individuals and smes are frequently confused by differing national standards for bank account numbers while the system is capable of being used for routing purposes it cannot at present be used to do so since the iban has not been widely adopted outside of europe and

that has no inflection to indicate person number mood or tense it is called the infinitive because the verb is usually not made finite or limited by inflection in some languages however there are inflected forms of the infinitive denoting attributes such as tense person and number it happens for example in portuguese there are languages that do not have infinitives at all for example arabic bulgarian and modern greek in some languages the infinitive can be construed as a verbal noun the infinitive is often used as the citation form as for many languages this is the basic lemma form of a verb which is usually presented in dictionaries in language classes children are sometimes taught to think of it as the name of the verb infinitives in english english has three non finite verbal forms but by long standing convention the term infinitive is applied to only one of these the other two are the past and present participle forms where the present participle form is also the gerund form in english a verb s infinitive is its unmarked form such as be do have or sit often introduced by the particle to when this particle is absent the infinitive is said to be a bare infinitive when it is present it is generally considered to be a part of the infinitive then known as the full infinitive or to infinitive and some grammarians hold that it should not be separated from the main word of the infinitive see split infinitive while many other languages including french and german use prepositions before the infinitive in much the same way english does de faire zu tun grammarians of those languages do not construe the prepositions as part of the infinitive to this extent the concept of the full infinitive though not the construction itself is uniquely english the bare infinitive and the full infinitive are not generally interchangeable but the distinction does not generally affect the meaning of a sentence rather certain contexts call almost exclusively for the bare infinitive and all other contexts call for the to infinitive uses of the bare infinitive the bare infinitive is used in a rather limited number of contexts but some of these are quite common the bare infinitive is used as the main verb after the dummy auxiliary verb do or any modal auxiliary verb such as will can or should except that ought usually takes a to infinitive so i will do can etc see it several common verbs of perception including see watch hear feel and sense take a direct object and a bare infinitive where the bare infinitive indicates an action taken by the main verb s direct object so i saw watched heard etc it happen a similar meaning can be effected by using the present participle instead i saw watched heard etc it happening the difference is that the former implies that the entirety of the event was perceived while the latter implies that part of the progress of the event was perceived similarly with several common verbs of permission or causation including make bid let and have so i made bade let had him do it however make takes a to infinitive in the passive voice i was made to do it the bare infinitive is the dictionary form of a verb and is generally the form of a verb that receives a definition however the definition itself generally uses a to infinitive so the word amble means to walk slowly the bare infinitive form is also the present subjunctive form and the imperative form although most grammarians do not consider uses of the present subjunctive or imperative to be uses of the bare infinitive uses of the full infinitive the full infinitive or to infinitive is used in a great many different contexts apart from in dictionary lemmata the full infinitive is the most commonly used citation form of the english verb how do we conjugate the verb to go it can serve as an ordinary noun expressing its action or state in an abstract general way so to be is to do a gerund can also be used for this being is doing it can serve as an adjective or adverb expressing purpose or intent so he is supposed to die at noon or in order to meditate one must free one s mind in either of the above uses it can often be given a subject using the preposition for for him to fail now would be a great disappointment in order for you to get there on time you ll need to leave now the former sentence could also be written his failing now would be a great disappointment it can be used after many intransitive verbs in this case it generally has the subject of the main verb as its implicit subject so i agreed to leave or he failed to make his case this may be considered a special case of the noun use above it can be used after the direct objects of many transitive verbs in this case it generally has the direct object of the main verb as its implicit subject so i convinced him to leave with me or he asked her to make his case on his behalf as a special case of the above it can often be used after an intransitive verb together with a subject using the preposition for i arranged for him to accompany me or i waited for summer to arrive when the verb is implied some dialects will reduce the to infinitive to simply to do i have to the infinitive with auxiliary verbs the auxiliary verb do is not used with the infinitive even though do is also a main verb and in that sense is often used in the infinitive one does not say i asked to do not have to but rather either i asked not to have to or i asked to not have to but see split infinitive similarly one cannot emphasize an infinitive using do one cannot say i hear him do say it all the time nonetheless the auxiliary verbs have used to form the perfect aspect and be used to form the passive voice and continuous aspect both commonly appear in the infinitive it s thought to have been a ceremonial site or i want to be doing it already defective verbs the modal auxiliary verbs can may shall will and must are defective in that they do not have infinitives so one cannot say i want him to can do it but rather must say i want him to be able to do it the circumlocutions to be able to to have to and to be going to are generally used in these cases germanic languages the original germanic suffix of the infinitive was an with verbs derived from other words ending in jan or janan in german it is en sagen with eln or ern endings on a few words based on l or r roots segeln ndern the use of zu with infinitives is less frequent than to in english they can function as nouns often expressing abstractions of the action in which case they are of neuter gender das essen means the the eating but also the food in dutch infinitives also end in en zeggen to say sometimes used with te similar to english to e g het is niet moeilijk te begrijpen it is not difficult to understand the few verbs with stems ending in a have infinitives in n gaan to go slaan to hit in scandinavian languages the n has dropped out and the infinitive suffix has been reduced to e or a romance languages romance infinitives can be used in much the same way as the infinitive is used in english and they can also sometimes function as masculine nouns in spanish and portuguese infinitives mostly end in ar er or ir a similar phenomenon also exists in french infinitives of verbs have the suffixes er ir re or oir italian follows a similar pattern with its infinitives ending in are ere ire or urre formation of the infinitive in romance languages reflects that of their ancestor latin in which a significant majority of verbs had an infinitive ending with re with a varying vowel called the thematical preceding it portuguese and its sister language galician is the only indo european language with a personal infinitive which helps to make infinitive clauses very common english finite sentences as so that you she we have has have would be translated to para teres ela ter termos the subject is dropped very often portuguese personal infinitive has only two proper tenses present and perfect but other tenses are replaced by periphrastic structures for instance although you sing sang will sing could be translated to apesar de cantares teres cantado ires cantar slavic languages the infinitive in russian usually ends in t preceded by a thematic vowel some verbs have a stem ending in a consonant and change the t to ch such as can some other slavic languages have the infinitive typically ending in however bulgarian and macedonian have lost the infinitive serbo croatian officially retains it but the infinitive is dying out in serbia hebrew language hebrew has two infinitives the infinitive absolute and the infinitive construct the infinitive construct is used after prepositions and is inflected with pronominal endings to indicate its subject or object bikht bh hass ph r when the scribe wrote ahare lekht after his going when the infinitive construct is preceded by l li l to it is identical in its meaning to the english to infinitive and this is its most frequent use in modern hebrew the infinitive absolute is used to add emphasis or certainty to the verb as in m th y m th literally die he will die figuratively he shall indeed die this construction is analogous to such english pleonasms as in he slept a sleep of peace this usage is commonplace in the bible but in modern hebrew it is restricted to high flown literary works note however that the to infinitive of hebrew is not the dictionary form that is the third person singular past tense finnish language to form the first infinitive the strong form of the root without consonant gradation or epenthetic e is used and these changes occur the root is suffixed with ta t according to vowel harmony consonant elision takes place if applicable e g juoks ta juosta assimilation of clusters violating sonority hierarchy if applicable e g nuol ta nuolla sur ta surra t weakens to d after diphthongs e g juo ta juoda t elides if intervocalic e g kirjoitta ta kirjoittaa as such it is inconvenient for dictionary use because the imperative would be closer to the root word nevertheless dictionaries use the first infinitive there are four other infinitives which create a noun or adverb like word from the verb for example the third infinitive is ma m which creates an adjective like word like written from write kirjoita becomes kirjoittama translation to languages without an infinitive in languages without an infinitive the infinitive is translated either as a that clause or as a verbal noun for example in literary arabic the phrase i want to write a book is translated as either ur du an aktuba kit ban literally i want that i should write a book with a verb in the subjunctive or ur du kit bata kit bin literally i want the writing of a book with the masdar or verbal noun and in demotic arabic biddi aktob ikt b subordinate clause with verb in subjunctive similarly the modern greek for i want to write as opposed to the ancient greek with the infinitive is which is literally i want that i should write see also auxiliary verb finite verb gerund split infinitive verbal noun parts of speech mary immaculate this article refers to the dogma of the immaculate conception of mary mother of jesus for the doctrine of the virginal conception of jesus christ see virgin birth christian doctrine the immaculate conception is a catholic dogma that asserts that mary the mother of jesus was preserved by god from the stain of original sin at the time of her own conception specifically the dogma says she was not afflicted by the lack of sanctifying grace that afflicts mankind but was instead filled with grace by god and furthermore lived a life completely free from sin it is commonly confused with the doctrine of the virgin birth though the two deal with separate subjects mary was conceived by normal biological means but her soul was acted upon by god kept immaculate at the time of her conception the immaculate conception was solemnly defined as a dogma by pope pius ix in his constitution ineffabilis deus published december eight one eight five four the feast of the immaculate conception the feast of the immaculate conception of mary had been established in one four eight three by pope sixtus iv who stopped short of defining the doctrine as a dogma of the catholic faith thus giving catholics freedom to believe in this or not this freedom had been reiterated by the council of trent the existence of the feast was a strong indication of the church s belief in the immaculate conception even before its one nine th century definition as a dogma the catholic church believes the dogma is supported by scripture e g her being greeted by angel gabriel as full of grace and by the writings of many of the church fathers either directly or indirectly and often calls mary the blessed virgin luke one four eight catholic theology maintains that since jesus became incarnate of the virgin mary she needed to be completely free of sin to bear the son of god and that mary is redeemed by the grace of christ but in a more perfect manner than other human beings ott fund bk three pt three ch two three one e in the catholic church the feast of the immaculate conception on eight december is generally a holy day of obligation and a public holiday in countries where catholicism is predominant prior to the spread of this doctrine december eight was celebrated as the conception of mary since september eight is the feast of the nativity of mary history of the doctrine aside from the acceptability of the doctrine of the immaculate conception and its necessity or lack thereof there is the history of its development within the catholic church the conception of mary was celebrated in england from the ninth century eadmer was influential in its spread the normans suppressed the celebration but it lived on in the popular mind it was rejected by st bernard of clairvaux alexander of hales and st bonaventure who teaching at paris called it this foreign doctrine indicating its association with england st thomas aquinas expressed questions about the subject but said that he would accept the determination of the church these famous churchmen had problems with the doctrine due to their understanding of human conception they did not believe that the soul was placed in the body at the moment of implantation in the womb aquinas and bonaventure for example believed that mary was completely free from sin but that she was not given this grace at the instant of her conception the oxford franciscans william of ware and especially blessed john duns scotus defended the doctrine despite the opposition of most scholarly opinion at the time scotus proposed a solution to the theological problems involved with reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in christ by arguing that mary s immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by christ but rather was the result of a more perfect redemption given to her on account of her special role in history furthermore scotus said that mary was redeemed in anticipation of christ s death on the cross this was similar to the way that the church explained the last supper since catholic theology teaches that the mass is the sacrifice of calvary made present on the altar and christ did not die before the last supper scotus defense of the immaculist thesis was summed up by one of his followers as potuit decuit ergo fecit god could do it it was fitting that he did it and so he did it following his defense of the thesis students at paris swore to defend the thesis and the tradition grew of swearing to defend the doctrine with one s blood popular opinion was firmly behind accepting this privilege for mary but such was the sensitivity of the issue and the authority of aquinas that it was not until one eight five four that pius ix with the support of the overwhelming majority of catholic bishops pronounced the doctrine infallible protestant and eastern orthodox opinion the doctrine is generally not shared by either eastern orthodoxy or by protestantism protestants generally reject the doctrine because they do not consider the development of dogmatic theology to be authoritative apart from biblical exegesis and the doctrine of the immaculate conception is not explicit in the bible it is accepted by some anglo catholics but is rejected by most in the anglican communion in the book of common prayer december eight is a lesser commemoration whose observance is optional however members of the society of mary are required to attend mass that day orthodox christians do believe that mary was without sin for her entire life but they do not share the catholic church s views on original sin they note that st augustine d four three zero whose works were not well known in eastern christianity until after the one seven th century has exerted considerable influence over the theology of sin that has generally taken root through the holy see and since eastern orthodoxy does not share rome s or most protestants view of original sin it considers unnecessary the doctrine that mary would require purification prior to the incarnation instead eastern orthodox theologians suggest that the references among the greek and syrian fathers to mary s purity and sinlessness may refer not to an a priori state but to her conduct after birth although this is not a dogma in the orthodox church there is the universal belief that there was a pre sanctification of mary at the time of her conception similar to the conception of saint john the baptist however there was no cleansing of original sin since orthodox christians believe that that one cannot inherit original sin or any sin for that matter instead original sin in orthodoxy refers to the general tendency towards sin and pain in the world caused by the fall of adam scriptural sources in his apostolic constitution ineffabilis deus december eight one eight five four which officially defined the immaculate conception as dogma for the catholic church pope pius ix primarily appealed to the text of genesis three one five where the serpent was told by god i will put enmity between you and the woman between your seed and her seed according to the catholic understanding this was a prophecy that foretold of a woman who would always be at enmity with the serpent that is a woman who would never be under the power of sin nor in bondage to the serpent some catholic theologians have also found scriptural evidence for the immaculate conception in the angel gabriel s greeting to mary at the annunciation recorded by saint luke in luke one two eight the english translation hail full of grace or hail favored one is based on the greek of luke one two eight chaire kecharitomene the latter word has the verb to grace as its root and the greek syntax indicates that the action of the verb was passive fully completed in the past with results continuing into the future put another way it means that the subject mary was graced fully and completely at some time in the past and continued in that fully graced state the church fathers almost from the beginning of church history found further scriptural evidence by comparing the figure of eve to the figure of mary st justin martyr said that mary was a kind of new eve in order that the disobedience which proceeded from the serpent might receive its destruction in the same manner in which it derived its origin dialogue with trypho one zero zero tertullian argued in the same manner saying as eve had believed the serpent so mary believed the angel the delinquency which the one occasioned by believing the other by believing effaced on the flesh of christ one seven st irenaeus declared that mary became the cause of salvation both to herself and the whole human race because what the virgin eve had bound fast through unbelief this did the virgin mary set free through faith

of jesus by mary nearly every time this term is used in the mass media it is in reference to the conception of jesus by mary the conception of jesus by mary is more properly called the incarnation of christ the phrase immaculate conception by catholic interpretation is not directly connected to the concept of the virgin birth the catholic church celebrates the immaculate conception on eight

indexes information retrieval ir is the art and science of searching for information in documents searching for documents themselves searching for metadata which describe documents or searching within databases whether relational stand alone databases or hypertext networked databases such as the internet or intranets for text sound images or data there is a common confusion however between data retrieval document retrieval information retrieval and text retrieval and each of these have their own bodies of literature theory praxis and technologies the term information retrieval was coined by calvin mooers in one nine four eight five zero ir is a broad interdisciplinary field that draws on many other disciplines indeed because it is so broad it is normally poorly understood being approached typically from only one perspective or another it stands at the junction of many established fields and draws upon cognitive psychology information architecture information design human information behaviour linguistics semiotics information science computer science and librarianship automated information retrieval ir systems were originally used to manage information explosion in scientific literature in the last few decades many universities and public libraries use ir systems to provide access to books journals and other documents ir systems are often related to object and query queries are formal statements of information needs that are put to an ir system by the user an object is an entity which keeps or stores information in a database user queries are matched to documents stored in a database a document is therefore a data object often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the ir system but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates in one nine nine two the department of defense along with the national institute of standards and technology nist cosponsored the text retrieval conference trec as part of the tipster text program the aim of this was to look into the information retrieval community by supplying the infrastructure that was needed for such a huge evaluation of text retrieval methodologies web search engines such as google and lycos are amongst the most visible applications of information retrieval research performance measures there are various ways to measure how well the retrieved information matches the intended information precision the proportion of relevant documents to all the documents retrieved p number of relevant documents retrieved number of documents retrieved in binary classification precision is analogous to positive predictive value precision can also be evaluated at a given cut off rank denoted p n instead of all retrieved documents recall the proportion of relevant documents that are retrieved out of all relevant documents available r number of relevant documents retrieved number of relevant documents in binary classification recall is called sensitivity f measure the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall the traditional f measure is f two times mathrm times mathrm mathrm mathrm this is also known as the f one measure because recall and precision are evenly weighted the general formula is f n one n two times mathrm times mathrm n two times mathrm mathrm two other commonly used f measures are the f measure which weights precision twice as much as recall and the f two measure which weights recall twice as much as precision mean average precision over a set of queries find the mean of the average precisions where average precision is the average of the precision after each relevant document is retrieved where r is the rank n the number retrieved rel a binary function on the relevance of a given rank and p precision at a given cut off rank operatornamep frac n p r times mathrm r this method emphasizes returning more relevant documents earlier model types classification of ir models translated from german entry original source dominik kuropka for a successful ir it is necessary to represent the documents in some way there are a number of models for this purpose they can be classified according to two dimensions like shown in the left figure the mathematical basis and the properties of the model translated from german entry original source dominik kuropka one dimension mathematical basis set theoretic models represent documents by sets similarities are usually derived from set theoretic operations on those sets common models are standard boolean model extended boolean model fuzzy retrieval algebraic models represent documents and queries usually as vectors matrices or tuples those vectors matrices or tuples are transformed by the use of a finite number of algebraic operations to a one dimensional similarity measurement vector space model generalized vector space model topic based vector space model extended boolean model enhanced topic based vector space model latent semantic indexing aka latent semantic analysis probabilistic models treat the process of document retrieval as a multistage random experiment similarities are thus represented as probabilities probabilistic theorems like the bayes theorem are often used in these models binary independence retrieval uncertain inference language models divergence from randomness models two dimension properties of the model models without term interdependencies treat different terms words as not interdependent this fact is usually represented in vector space models by the orthogonality assumption of term vectors or in probabilistic models by an independency assumption for term veriables models with immanent term interdependencies allow a representation of interdependencies between terms however the degree of the interdependency between two terms is defined by the model itself it is usually directly or indirectly derived e g by dimensional reduction from the co occurrence of those terms in the whole set of documents models with transcendent term interdependencies allow a representation of interdependencies between terms but they do not allege how the interdependency between two terms is defined they relay an an external source for the degree of interdependency between two terms for example a human or sophisticated algorithms open source information retrieval systems galatex

accomplished one spearheading the shift from impunity to accountability pointing out that until very recently it was the only court judging crimes committed as part of the yugoslav conflict since prosecutors in the former yugsolavia were as a rule reluctant to prosecute such crimes two establishing the facts highlighting the extensive evidence gathering and lengthy findings of fact that tribunal judgments produced three bringing justice to thousands of victims and giving them a voice pointing out the large number of witnesses that had been brought before the tribunal four the accomplishments in international law describing the fleshing out of several international criminal law concepts which had not been ruled on since the nuremberg trials five strengthening the rule of law referring to the tribunal s role in promoting the use of international standards in war crimes prosecutions by former yugoslav republics criticisms of the court some of the criticisms levelled against the court include it was established by the un security council instead of the un general assembly the un charter specifically gives the exclusive right to establish such organs to the general assembly this has been the formal basis of milo evi s claim that the court has no legal authority it was established on the basis of the chapter vii of the un charter relevant portion of the charter reads the security council can take measures to maintain or restore international peace and security it is disputed whether a tribunal could be considered a measure to maintain or restore international peace and security an apparently disproportionately large number of indictees are serbs to the extent that a sizeable portion of the bosnian serb and serbian political and military leaderships have been indicted whereas there have been very few indictments resulting from crimes committed against serbs many croat indictees were charged with crimes committed against bosnian muslims furthermore serbian indictees are of higher rank than those of other nations and face with broader accusations defenders of the tribunal respond that serb control of the established command structure and most of the weaponry of the yugoslav people s army jna from the start of the various wars facilitated the commission of crimes on a wider and more organised scale furthermore the serb command structure facilitated the identification of those with command responsibility for war crimes however this fails to explain why a number of specific crimes committed against serbs are not prosecuted many of the indictees are still not apprehended which reflects badly on its image defenders point out that the tribunal has no powers of arrest and is reliant on other agencies notably national governments eufor and kfor to apprehend and extradite indictees the tribunal s power to issue secret indictments creates uncertainty among people who regard themselves as possible indictees which places an unreasonable strain on their ability to proceed with their everyday lives both in the short and long term the tribunal in effect makes no distinction between the bosnian croatian and serbian languages issuing documents in what it terms b c s bosnian croatian serbian with no regard to differences between the three see serbo croatian language supporters of this approach respond that since all three forms are mutually intelligible to a high degree and indeed were officially considered to be single language before the breakup of the former yugoslavia separate translations are not needed however despite the fact that most of the indictees are serbs the tribunal exclusively uses translators who speak bosnian and croatian languages some of the indictees have filed complaints about not being able to fully understand the translations the tribunal has not prosecuted the citizens of any nato countries as a result of nato s involvement in the kosovo conflict nato spokesman jamie shea said the following about the court nato countries are those that have provided the finance to set up the tribunal we are amongst the majority financiers and of course to build a second chamber so that prosecutions can be speeded up so let me assure that we and the tribunal are all one on this we want to see war criminals brought to justice and i am certain that when justice arbour goes to kosovo and looks at the facts she will be indicting people of yugoslav nationality and i don t anticipate any others at this stage the tribunal is funded by approved appropriations made by the fifth committee of the general assembly nato countries contribute to the budget as they are members of the un and hence they get assesed for it as approved however a significant portion of the budget is voluntary funding done mostly by nato and muslim countries the un general assembly publishes the tribunal s annual budget and audited financial statements in december two zero zero three wesley clark testified behind closed doors during slobodan milo evi s trial in the one nine nine zero s clark had spoken with milosevic for more than one zero zero hours in his role as the head of the u s military team during the dayton agreement negotiations and as nato s supreme allied commander in europe critics of the court took clark s testimony as a prime example of the court s flaws during clark s cross examination by milosevic the following exchange is found milosevic interpretation general clark is it true that in an interview that you gave for the new yorker on the one seven th of november you said that the war that you waged was technically illegal judge richard may presiding cuts milo evi off and some back and forth follows between the two in which judge may reminds milo evi that since milo evi is cross examining general clark he can only address matters regarding which the witness was asked to testify during the examination in chief by the prosecutions counsel since the legality of the nato military action was not discussed during examination in chief the rules of procedure do not permit milo evi to raise that issue during cross examination at the end of the exchange milo evi asks milosevic interpretation so i cannot ask him anything at all about the war waged by nato against yugoslavia is that what you re saying judge may yes milosevic interpretation well mr may that really is an example showing that this is truly nothing more than a farce milosevic was required to call clark as his own witness to open these lines of questioning critics have questioned whether the tribunal exascerbates tensions rather than promotes reconciliation as is claimed by tribunal supporters polls show a generally negative reaction to the tribunal among the serb and croat public the majority of croats and serbs doubt the tribunal s integrity and question the tenability of its legal procedures although the serbs s and croats s opinions on the court are almost always exactly the opposite with regard to the cases that involve both parties on the other hand kosovo albanians and bosnian muslims have frequently expressed their high regard for the court and the trust in its impartiality critics even within the united nations have complained of the tribunal s high cost the two year budget for the tribunal for two zero zero four and two zero zero five was two seven one eight five four six zero zero usd the cost is borne by all u n members critics have also complained of the length of trials with some extending for several years supporters of the tribunal respond that many of the defendants are charged with multiple crimes against many victims all of which must be proven beyond reasonable doubt thus requiring long trials simultaneous translation also slows

so that it has an area of one m prior to the above mentioned rounding successive paper sizes in the series a one a two a three etc are defined by halving the preceding paper size parallel to its shorter side again prior to rounding the most frequently used paper size is a four which is two one zero two nine seven mm b series the b series formats are geometric means between the a series format with the same number and the a series format with one lower number for example b one is a geometric mean between a one and a zero the sides of b zero are one m to two m there is also an incompatible

series format with the same number and the a series format with the same number e g c two is the geometric mean between b two and a two the c series formats are used mainly for envelopes an a four page will fit into a c four envelope if you fold the a four page so that it is a five in size it will fit in a c five envelope and so on application prior to the adoption of iso two one six many different paper formats were used internationally these formats did not fit into a coherent system and were defined in terms of non metric units the iso two one six formats are organized around the ratio one two two sheets next to each other together have the same ratio sideways this simplifies copying two a four sheets in reduced size on one and copying an a four sheet in magnified size on an a three sheet or copying half an a four sheet in magnified size on an a four sheet the principal countries not generally using the iso paper sizes are the united states of america and canada which use

product prod a n a one a two a three cdots is defined to be the limit of the partial products a one a two a n as n goes to infinity the product is said to converge when the limit exists and is not zero otherwise the product is said to diverge the value zero is treated specially in order to get results analogous to those for infinite sums if the product converges then the limit of the sequence a n as n goes to infinity must be one while the converse is in general not true therefore the logarithm log a n will be defined for all but finitely many n and for those we have log prod a n sum log a n with the product on the left converging if and only if the sum on the right does this allows the translation of convergence criteria for infinite sums into convergence criteria for infinite products

is that every entire function f z i e every function that is holomorphic over the entire complex plane can be factored into an infinite product of entire functions each with at most a single zero in

lbrace frac left frac right two cdots left frac right right rbrace where n are positive integers that can be chosen to make the series converge and z is some uniquely determined analytic function which means the term before the product will have no zeros in the complex plane the above factorization is not unique since it depends on the choice of n s and is not especially elegant for most functions though there will be some minimum positive integer p such that n p gives a convergent product called the canonical product representation and in the event that p one this takes the form f z

extensive correspondence with leading christian scholars of his time most notably with the philosopher ralph cudworth master of christ s college cambridge middle ages rabbis alternative meaning i ching monk the i ching is the oldest of the chinese classic texts it describes an ancient system of cosmology and philosophy which is at the heart of chinese cultural beliefs the philosophy centers on the ideas of the dynamic balance of opposites the evolution of events as a process and acceptance of the inevitability of change see philosophy below in western cultures the i ching is regarded by some as simply a system of divination many believe it expresses the wisdom and philosophy of ancient china implications of the title used as an adjective it means easy or simple while as a verb it implies to change j ng here means classic text which derived from its original meaning of regularity or persistency implying that the text describes the ultimate way which will not change throughout the flow of time the conception behind this title thus is profound it has three implications simplicity the root of the substance the fundamental law underlying everything in the universe is utterly plain and simple no matter how abstruse or complex some things may appear to be variability the use of the substance everything in the universe is continually changing by comprehending this one may realize the importance of flexibility in life and may thus cultivate the proper attitude for dealing with a multiplicity of diverse situations persistency the essence of the substance everything in the universe seems to be changing yet among the changing tides there is a persistent principle which is the change itself like in sunrise and set full moon half moon that means persistency cheerz commented on by zheng xuan zh ng x an in his writings critique of i ching y z n and commentary on i ching y l n of eastern han dynasty due to the profound ideas conveyed by the title itself it is practically impossible to arrive at an unbiased translation which could preserve the original concepts intact the translation of the title into english used to be book of changes though a slightly more accurate name classic of changes appears more frequently in recent use history traditional view traditionally it was believed that the principles of the i ching originated with the legendary fu hsi f x in this respect he is seen as an early culture hero one of the earliest legendary rulers of china traditional dates two eight five two bce two seven three eight bce reputed to have had the trigrams b g a revealed to him supernaturally by the time of yu y trigrams had been developed into hexagrams l u sh s g a which were recorded in the scripture lian shan li n sh n also called lian shan yi lian shan meaning continuous mountains in chinese begins with the hexagram bound g n which depicts a mountain mounting on another and is believed to be the origin of the scripture s name after the xia dynasty was overthrown by the shang dynasty the hexagrams were re deduced to form gui cang g i c ng also called gui cang yi and the hexagram field k n became the first hexagram gui cang may be literally translated into return and be contained which refers to earth as the first hexagram itself indicates at the time of shang s last king zhou wang king wen of zhou deduced the hexagram and discovered that the hexagrams beginning with force qi n revealed the rise of zhou he then gave each hexagram a description regarding its own nature thus gua ci gu c explanation of hexagrams when king wu of zhou son of king wen toppled the shang dynasty his brother zhou gong dan created yao ci y o c explanation of horizontal lines to clarify the significance of each horizontal line in each hexagram it was not until then that the whole context of i ching was understood its philosophy heavily influenced the literature and government administration of the zhou dynasty one one two two bce two five six bce later during the time of spring and autumn seven two two bce four eight one bce confucius wrote shi yi sh y ten wings an introductory comment on the i ching by the time of han wu di h n w d of the western han dynasty circa two zero zero bce shi yi was often called yi zhuan y zh an commentary on the i ching and together with the i ching they composed zhou yi zh u y changes of zhou all later texts about zhou yi were explanations only due to the classic s deep meaning western modernist view in the past five zero years a modernist history of the i ching has been emerging based on context criticism and research into shang and zhou dynasty oracle bones as well as zhou bronze inscriptions and other sources see below these reconstructions are dealt with in a growing number of books such as the mandate of heaven hidden history in the i ching by s j marshall and richard rutt s zhouyi the book of changes see references below scholarly works dealing with the new view of the book of changes include doctoral dissertations by richard kunst and edward shaughnessy these and other scholars have been helped immensely by the discovery in the one nine seven zero s by chinese archaeologists of intact han dynasty era tombs in mawangdui near changsha hunan province one of the tombs contained more or less complete two nd century bce texts of the i ching the dao de jing and other works which are mostly similar yet in some ways diverge significantly from the received or traditional texts preserved by the chances of history the tomb texts include additional commentaries on the i ching previously unknown and apparently written as if they were meant to be attributed to confucius all of the mawangdui texts are many centuries older than the earliest known attestations of the texts in question when talking about the evolution of the book of changes therefore the modernists contend that it is important to distinguish between the traditional history assigned to texts such as the i ching felt to be anachronistic by the modernists assignations in commentaries which have themselves been canonized over the centuries along with their subjects and the more recent scholarly history aided by modern linguistic textual criticism and archaeology many hold that these perspectives are not necessarily mutually exclusive but for instance many modernist scholars doubt the actual existence of fuxi think confucius had nothing to do with the book of changes and contend that the hexagrams came before the trigrams structure the i ching symbolism is embodied in a set of six four abstract line arrangements called hexagrams gu these are each composed of six stacked horizontal lines y o each line is either yang unbroken a solid line or yin broken an open line with a gap in the centre with six such lines stacked from bottom to top in each hexagram there are two six or six four possible combinations and thus six four hexagrams each hexagram is considered to be composed of two three line arrangements called trigrams gu there are two three hence eight possible trigrams each hexagram represents a state a process and may represent a change happening when a hexagram is cast using one of the processes of divination with i ching each of the lines may be indicated as moving or fixed moving old or unstable lines have a polarity in the process of reversal a full reading will consider the hexagram that would result from the lines changing polarity the traditional methods for casting the hexagrams use biased random number generation procedures so the six four hexagrams are not equiprobable there are a few formal arrangements of the trigrams and hexagrams with a traditional context the b g a is a circular arrangement of the trigrams traditionally printed on a mirror or disk according to legend fu hsi found the b g a on the scales of a tortoise s back the king wen sequence is considered the authoritative arrangement of the hexagrams components of hexagrams the solid line represents yang the creative principle the open line represents yin the receptive principle these principles are also represented in a common circular symbol known as taijitu but more commonly known in the west as the yin yang diagram expressing the idea of complementarity of changes when yang is at top yin is increasing and the reverse in the following lists the trigrams and hexagrams are represented using a common textual convention horizontally from left to right using for yang and for yin note though that the normal diagrammatic representation is to show the lines stacked vertically from bottom to top i e to visualize the actual trigrams or hexagrams rotate the text counterclockwise nine zero there are eight possible trigrams b gu trigramnamenaturedirection one

unicode philosophy gradations of binary expression based on yin and yang old yang old yin young yang or young yin see the divination paragraph below are what the hexagrams are built from yin and yang while common expressions associated with many schools known from classical chinese culture are especially associated with the taoists another view holds that the i ching is primarily a confucianist ethical or philosophical document this view is based upon the following the wings or appendices are attributed to confucius the study of the i ching was required as part of the civil service exams these exams only studied confucianist texts it is one of the five confucian classics it does not appear in any surviving editions of the dao zheng the major commentaries were written by confucianists or neo confucianists both views may be seen to show that the i ching was at the heart of chinese thought serving as a common ground for the confucian and taoist schools partly forgotten due to the rise of chinese buddhism during the tang dynasty the i ching returned to the attention of scholars during the song dynasty this was concomitant with the reassessment of confucianism by confucians in the light of taoist and buddhist metaphysics and is known in the west as neo confucianism the book unquestionably an ancient chinese scripture helped song confucian thinkers to synthesize buddhist and taoist cosmologies with confucian and mencian ethics the end product was a new cosmogony that could be linked to the so called lost tao of confucius and mencius binary sequence in his article explication de l arithm tique binaire one seven zero three gottfried leibniz writes that he has found in the hexagrams a base for claiming the universality of the binary numeral system he takes the layout of the combinatorial exercise found in the hexagrams to represent binary sequences so that would correspond to the binary sequence zero zero zero zero zero zero and would be zero zero zero zero zero one and so forth the binary arrangement of hexagrams was developed by the famous chinese scholar and philosopher shao yung a neo confucian and taoist in the one one th century he displayed it in two different formats a circle and a rectangular block thus he clearly understood the sequence represented a logical progression of values however while it is true that these sequences do represent the values zero through six three in a binary display there is no evidence that shao understood that the numbers could be used in computations such as addition or subtraction divination the i ching has long been used as an oracle and many different ways coexist to cast a reading i e a hexagram with its dynamic relationship to others symbolism the flag of south korea with t ij t in the center with four trigrams representing heaven water earth and fire beginning top left and proceeding clockwise flag of the empire of vietnam uses hexagram number three zero the flag of south korea contains the t ai chi symbol or t ij t yin and yang in dynamic balance called taeguk in korean representing the origin of all things in the universe the taijitu is surrounded by four of the eight trigrams starting from top left and going clockwise heaven water earth fire the flag of the empire of vietnam used the hexagram number three zero and was known as c qu ly li hexagram flag because the hexagram represents south its successor the republic of vietnam connected the middle lines turning it into hexagram number one see flag of the republic of vietnam influence on western culture the i ching has

protocol suite it is an open all volunteer standards organization with no formal membership or membership requirements it is organized into a large number of working groups each dealing with a specific topic and intended to complete work on that topic and then shut down each working group has an appointed chair or sometimes several co chairs along with a charter that describes its focus and what and when it is expected to produce the working groups are organized into areas by subject matter each area is overseen by an area director ad most areas have two co ad s the ads appoint working group chairs the area directors together with the ietf chair form the internet engineering steering group iesg which is responsible for the overall operation of the ietf the ietf is formally an activity under the umbrella of the internet society the ietf is overseen by the internet architecture board iab which oversees its external relationships and relations with the rfc editor the iab is also jointly responsible for the ietf administrative oversight committee iaoc which oversees the ietf administrative support activity iasa which provides logistical etc support for the ietf the iab also manages the internet research task force irtf with which the ietf has a number of cross group relations history the first ietf meeting was on january one six one nine eight six consisting of two one u s government funded researchers initially it met quarterly but from one nine nine one it s been meeting three times a year representatives from non government vendors were invited starting with the fourth ietf meeting in october of that year since that time all ietf meetings have been open to anyone the majority of the ietf s work is done on mailing lists however and meeting attendance is not required for contributors the initial meetings were very small with less than three five people in attendance at each of the first five meetings and with the peak attendance in the first one three meetings of only one two zero attendees at the one two th meeting in january of one nine eight nine it has grown in both participation and scope a great deal since the early nine zero s it had a peak attendance of almost three zero zero zero at the december two zero zero zero ietf held in san diego ca attendance declined with industry restructuring in the early two zero zero zero s and is currently around one three zero zero during the early one nine nine zero s the ietf changed institutional form from an activity of the u s government to an independent international activity associated with the internet society the ietf has at times been ascribed nearly magical abilities by the trade press who assumed its mechanisms were responsible for the success of the internet because it works on the internet s core protocols the reality that it is a group of engineers putting together specifications so that multiple vendors products can interoperate across networks is considerably more prosaic the details of its operations have changed considerably as it has grown but the basic mechanism remains publication of draft specifications review and independent testing by participants and republication interoperability is the chief test for ietf specifications becoming standards most of its specifications are focused on single protocols rather than tightly interlocked systems this has allowed its protocols to be used in many different systems and its standards are routinely re used by bodies which create full fledged architectures e g three gpp ims because it relies on volunteers and uses rough consensus and running code as its touchstone it can however be slow whenever the number of volunteers is either too small to make progress or so large as to make consensus difficult for protocols like smtp which is used to transport e mail for a user community in the many hundreds of millions there is also considerable resistance to any change which is not fully backwards compatible work within the ietf on ways to improve its speed is ongoing but because the number of volunteers with opinions on it is very great consensus mechanisms on how to improve have been slow to emerge list of ietf chairs the ietf chair is selected by the nomcom process specified in rfc three seven seven seven for a two year term renewable before one nine nine three the ietf

series is represented as a list of numbers with addition operations between them e g one two three four five which may or may not be meaningful as it will be explained below in most cases of interest the terms of the sequence are produced according to a certain rule such as by a formula by an algorithm by a sequence of measurements or even by a random number generator series may be finite or infinite in the first case they may be handled with elementary algebra but infinite series require tools from mathematical analysis if they are to be applied in anything more than a tentative way examples of simple series include the arithmetic series which is a sum of an arithmetic progression written as sum k an b and finite geometric series a sum of a geometric progression which can be written as sum k a infinite series the sum of an infinite series is a limit of partial sums of infinitely many terms such a limit can have a finite value if it has the series is said to converge if it does not it is said to diverge the fact that infinite series can converge resolves several of zeno s paradoxes the simplest convergent infinite series is perhaps one frac frac frac frac cdots it is possible to visualize its convergence on the real number line we can imagine a line of length two with successive segments marked off of lengths one one two one four etc there is always room to mark the next segment because the amount of line remaining is always the same as the last segment marked when we have marked off one two we still have a piece of length one two unmarked so we can certainly mark the next one four this argument does not prove that the sum is equal to two although it is but it does prove that it is at most two in other words the series has an upper bound this series is a geometric series and mathematicians usually write it as sum infty two two an infinite series is formally written as sum infty a n where the elements a n are real or complex numbers we say that this series converges towards s or that its value is s if the limit lim sum n a n exists and is equal to s if there is no such number then the series is said to diverge the sequence of partial sums is defined as the sequence sum n a n indexed by n then the definition of series convergence simply says that the sequence of partial sums has limit s as n formal definition mathematicians usually define a series as the above sequence of partial sums the notation sum infty a n represents then a priori this sequence which is always well defined but which may or may not converge only in the latter case i e if this sequence has a limit the notation is also used to denote the limit of this sequence to make a distinction between these two completely different objects sequence vs numerical value one may sometimes omit the limits atop and below the sum s symbol in the former case although it is usually clear from the context which one is meant also different notions of convergence of such a sequence do exist absolute convergence summability etc in case the elements of the sequence and thus of the series are not simple numbers but for example functions still more types of convergence can be considered pointwise convergence uniform convergence etc see below history of the theory of infinite series development of infinite series the idea of an infinite series expansion of a function was first conceived in india by madhava in the one four th century who also developed the concepts of the power series the taylor series the maclaurin series rational approximations of infinite series and infinite continued fractions he discovered a number of infinite series including the taylor series of the trigonometric functions of sine cosine tangent and arctangent the taylor series approximations of the sine and cosine functions and the power series of the radius diameter circumference angle and four his students and followers in the kerala school further expanded his works with various other series expansions and approximations until the one six th century in the one seven th century james gregory also worked on infinite series and published several maclaurin series in one seven one five a general method for constructing the taylor series for all functions for which they exist was provided by brook taylor leonhard euler in the one eight th century developed the theory of hypergeometric series and q series convergence criteria the study of the convergence criteria of a series began with madhava in the one four th century who developed tests of convergence of infinite series which his followers further developed at the kerala school in europe however the investigation of the validity of infinite series is considered to begin with gauss in the one nine th century euler had already considered the hypergeometric series one fracx fracx two cdots on which gauss published a memoir in one eight one two it established simpler criteria of convergence and the questions of remainders and the range of convergence cauchy one eight two one insisted on strict tests of convergence he showed that if two series are convergent their product is not necessarily so and with him begins the discovery of effective criteria the terms convergence and divergence had been introduced long before by gregory one six six eight euler and gauss had given various criteria and maclaurin had anticipated some of cauchy s discoveries cauchy advanced the theory of power series by his expansion of a complex function in such a form abel one eight two six in his memoir on the series one fracx fracx two cdots corrected certain of cauchy s conclusions and gave a completely scientific summation of the series for complex values of m and x he showed the necessity of considering the subject of continuity in questions of convergence cauchy s methods led to special rather than general criteria and the same may be said of raabe one eight three two who made the first elaborate investigation of the subject of de morgan from one eight four two whose logarithmic test dubois reymond one eight seven three and pringsheim one eight eight nine have shown to fail within a certain region of bertrand one eight four two bonnet one eight four three malmsten one eight four six one eight four seven the latter without integration stokes one eight four seven paucker one eight five two tchebichef one eight five two and arndt one eight five three general criteria began with kummer one eight three five and have been studied by eisenstein one eight four seven weierstrass in his various contributions to the theory of functions dini one eight six seven dubois reymond one eight seven three and many others pringsheim s from one eight eight nine memoirs present the most complete general theory uniform convergence the theory of uniform convergence was treated by cauchy one eight two one his limitations being pointed out by abel but the first to attack it successfully were stokes and seidel one eight four seven four eight cauchy took up the problem again one eight five three acknowledging abel s criticism and reaching the same conclusions which stokes had already found thom used the doctrine one eight six six but there was great delay in recognizing the importance of distinguishing between uniform and non uniform convergence in spite of the demands of the theory of functions semi convergence semi convergent series were studied by poisson one eight two three who also gave a general form for the remainder of the maclaurin formula the most important solution of the problem is due however to jacobi one eight three four who attacked the question of the remainder from a different standpoint and reached a different formula this expression was also worked out and another one given by malmsten one eight four seven schl milch zeitschrift vol i p one nine two one eight five six also improved jacobi s remainder and showed the relation between the remainder and bernoulli s function f x one n two n cdots x one n genocchi one eight five two has further contributed to the theory among the early writers was wronski whose loi supr me one eight one five was hardly recognized until cayley one eight seven three brought it into prominence fourier series fourier series were being investigated as the result of physical considerations at the same time that gauss abel and cauchy were working out the theory of infinite series series for the expansion of sines and cosines of multiple arcs in powers of the sine and cosine of the arc had been treated by jakob bernoulli one seven zero two and his brother johann bernoulli one seven zero one and still earlier by vi te euler and lagrange simplified the subject as did poinsot schr ter glaisher and kummer fourier one eight zero seven set for himself a different problem to expand a given function of x in terms of the sines or cosines of multiples of x a problem which he embodied in his th orie analytique de la chaleur one eight two two euler had already given the formulas for determining the coefficients in the series fourier was the first to assert and attempt to prove the general theorem poisson one eight two zero two three also attacked the problem from a different standpoint fourier did not however settle the question of convergence of his series a matter left for cauchy one eight two six to attempt and for dirichlet one eight two nine to handle in a thoroughly scientific manner see convergence of fourier series dirichlet s treatment crelle one eight two nine of trigonometric series was the subject of criticism and improvement by riemann one eight five four heine lipschitz schl fli and dubois reymond among other prominent contributors to the theory of trigonometric and fourier series were dini hermite halphen krause byerly and appell some types of infinite series a geometric series is one where each successive term is produced by multiplying the previous term by a constant number example one cdots sum infty in general the geometric series sum infty z n converges if and only if z one cdots sum infty an alternating series is a series where terms alternate signs example one cdots sum infty one the series sum infty frac converges if r one and diverges for r one which can be shown with the integral criterion described below in convergence tests as a function of r the sum of this series is riemann s zeta function a telescoping series sum infty b n b converges if the sequence b n converges to a limit l as n goes to infinity the value of the series is then b one l absolute convergence main article absolute convergence a series sum infty a n is said to converge absolutely if the series of absolute values sum infty left a n right converges in this case the original series and all reorderings of it converge and converge towards the same sum the riemann series theorem says that if a series converges but not absolutely then one can always find a reordering of the terms so that the reordered series diverges moreover if the a n are real and s is any real number one can find a reordering so that the reordered series converges with limit s convergence tests comparison test one if bn is an absolutely convergent series such that an c bn for some number c and for sufficiently large n then an converges absolutely as well if bn diverges and an bn for all sufficiently large n then an also fails to converge absolutely though it could still be conditionally convergent e g if the an alternate in sign comparison test two if bn is an absolutely convergent series such that an one an c bn one bn for some number c and for sufficiently large n then an converges absolutely as well if bn diverges and an one an bn one bn for all sufficiently large n then an also fails to converge absolutely though it could still be conditionally convergent e g if the an alternate in sign ratio test if a n one a n n converges absolutely when the ratio is one convergence can sometimes be determined as well root test if there exists a constant c n one n c for all sufficiently large n then a n converges absolutely integral test if f x is a positive monotone decreasing function defined on the interval one with f n a n for all n then a n converges if and only if the integral one f x d x is finite alternating series test a series of the form one n a n with a n zero is called alternating such a series converges if the sequence a n is monotone decreasing and converges to zero the converse is in general not true for some specific types of series there are more specialized convergence tests for instance for fourier series there is the dini test power series several important functions can be represented as taylor series these are infinite series involving powers of the independent variable and are also called power series for example the series sum infty frac converges to e x for all x see also radius of convergence historically mathematicians such as leonhard euler operated liberally with infinite series even if they were not convergent when calculus was put on a sound and correct foundation in the nineteenth century rigorous proofs of the convergence of series were always required however the formal operation with non convergent series has been retained in rings of formal power series which are studied in abstract algebra formal power series are also used in combinatorics to describe and study sequences that are otherwise difficult to handle this is the method of generating functions generalizations asymptotic series otherwise asymptotic expansions are infinite series that do not converge but they are useful as sequences of approximations each of which provides a value close to the desired answer for a finite number of terms the difference is that an asymptotic series cannot be made to produce an answer as exact as desired the way that convergent series can in fact after a certain number of terms a typical asymptotic series reaches its best approximation if more terms are included most such series will produce worse answers the notion of series can be defined in every abelian topological group the most commonly encountered case is that of series in a banach space there is no serious definition for an infinite sum over an uncountable set for example if x is a set and f a function on x taking non negative real values such that sum f y for any countable subset y of x with a an absolute constant it follows that f x zero for all x outside some countable subset of x in other words infinite sums of uncountably many non negative reals make sense only in the case that this is a conventional convergent infinite series extended by the value zero to an uncountable set see also convergent series divergent series sequence transformations calculus mathematical series in computer science an interrupt is an asynchronous signal from hardware or software indicating the need for attention a hardware interrupt causes the processor to save its state of execution via a context switch and begins execution of an interrupt handler software interrupts are usually implemented as instructions in the instruction set which cause a context switch to the interrupt handler similarly to a hardware interrupt the act of interrupting is referered to as an interrupt request overview interrupts originated as a way to avoid wasting the processor s valuable time in polling loops waiting for external events instead an interrupt signals the processor when an event occurs allowing the processor to process other work while the event is pending interrupts may be implemented in hardware as a distinct system with control lines or they may be integrated into the memory subsystem if implemented in hardware a programmable interrupt controller pic or advanced programmable interrupt controller apic is connected to both the interrupting device and to the processor s interrupt pin if implemented as part of the memory controller interrupts are mapped into the system s memory address space interrupts can be categorized into the following types software interrupt maskable interrupt non maskable interrupt nmi interprocessor interrupt ipi and spurious interrupt a software interrupt is an interrupt generated within a processor by executing an instruction examples of software interrupts are system calls a maskable interrupt is essentially a hardware interrupt which may be ignored by setting a bit in an interrupt mask register s imr bit mask likewise a non maskable interrupt is a hardware interrupt which typically does not have a bit mask associated with it allowing it to be ignored an interprocessor interrupt is a special type of interrupt which is generated by one processor to interrupt another processor in a multiprocessor system a spurious interrupt is a hardware interrupt which is generated by system errors such as electrical noise on one of the pics interrupt lines processors typically have an internal interrupt mask which allows software to ignore all external hardware interrupts while it is set this mask may offer faster access than accessing an imr in a pic or disabling interrupts in the device itself in some cases such as the x eight six architecture disabling and enabling interrupts on the processor itself acts as a memory barrier in which case it may actually be slower the phenomenon where the overall system performance is severely hindered by excessive amounts of processing time spent handling interrupts is called an interrupt storm or live lock typical uses typical interrupt uses include the following system timers disks io power off signals and traps other interrupts exist to transfer data bytes using uarts or ethernet sense key presses control motors or anything else the equipment must do a classic system timer interrupt interrupts periodically from a counter or the power line the interrupt handler counts the interrupts to keep time the timer interrupt may also be used by the os s task scheduler to reschedule the priorities of running processes counters are popular but some older computers used the power line frequency instead because power companies in most western countries control the power line frequency with an atomic clock a disk interrupt signals the completion of a data transfer from or to the disk peripheral a process waiting to read or write a file starts up again a power off interrupt predicts or requests a loss of power it allows the computer equipment to perform an orderly shutdown interrupts are also used in typeahead features for buffering events

links interrupts made easy interrupts for other meanings of intercalation see intercalation disambiguation the solar year does not have whole number of days but a calendar year must have a whole number of days the only way to reconcile the two is to vary the number of days in the calendar year in many calendars this is done by adding to a common year of three six five days an extra day leap day or intercalary day this makes a leap year of three six six days in the gregorian calendar the intercalary day is february two nine the solar year does not have a whole number of lunar months either so a lunisolar calendar must have a variable number of months in a year this is usually one two months but sometimes a one three th month an intercalary or embolismic month is added to the year

pennsylvania an ink is a liquid containing various pigments and or dyes used for colouring a surface to render an image or text common perceptions consider ink for use in drawing or writing with a pen or brush however ink can be of a paste form this kind of ink is used most extensively in letterpress and lithographic printing inkpots with penholder types of ink early varieties of ink include indian ink various natural dyes made from metals the husk or outer covering of nuts or seeds and sea creatures like the squid known as sepia india ink is black and originated in asia walnut ink and iron gall nut ink were made and used by many of the early masters to obtain the golden brown ink used for drawing pigmented inks pigmented inks contain other agents that ensure adhesion of the pigment to the surface and prevent it from being removed by mechanical abrasion these materials are typically referred to as resins in solvent based inks or binding agents in water based inks pigmented inks are advantageous when printing on paper because the pigment stays on the surface of the paper this is desirable because more ink on the surface of the paper means less ink needs to be used to create the same intensity of color dyes in inks dyes however are generally much stronger and can produce more color of a given density per unit of mass however because dyes are dissolved in the liquid phase they have a tendency to soak into paper thus making the ink less efficient and also potentially allowing for the ink to bleed at the edges producing poor quality printing to circumvent this problem dye based inks are made with solvents that dry rapidly or are used with quick drying methods of printing such as blowing hot air on the fresh print other methods to resolve this include harder paper sizing and more specialized paper coatings the latter is particularly suited to inks that are used in non industrial settings and thus must conform to tighter toxicity and emission controls such as inkjet printer inks include coating the paper with a charged coating if the dye has the opposite charge then it is attracted to and retained by this coating while the solvent soaks into the paper cellulose the material that paper is made of is also naturally charged and so a compound that complexes with both the dye and the paper surface aids retention at the surface such a compound in common use in ink jet printing inks is polyvinyl pyrrolidone an additional advantage of dye based ink systems is that the dye molecules interact chemically with other ink ingredients this means that they can benefit more than pigmented ink from optical brighteners and colour enhancing agents designed to increase the intensity and appearance of dyes because dyes get their colour from the interaction of electrons in their molecules the way in which the electrons can move is determined by the charge and extent of electron delocalisation in the other ink ingredients the colour emerges as a function of the light energy that falls on the dye thus if an optical brightener or colour enhancer absorbs light energy and emits it through or with the dye the appearance changes as the spectrum of light re emitted to the observer changes a disadvantage of dye based inks is that they can be more susceptible to fading especially when exposed to ultraviolet radiation as in sunlight pigments contain the different colors pigments are the main components of the inks the size of the pigment is very important for the ability of diffuse in the solution inks denpending the sources and kind of the pigments

of pictures and texts carved in stone this early ink was a mixture of soot from pine smoke lamp oil and gelatin from animal skins and musk other early cultures also developed inks of many colors from available berries plants and minerals in an article for the christian science monitor sharon j huntington describes these other historical inks about one six zero zero years ago a popular ink recipe was created the recipe was used for centuries iron salts such as ferrous sulfate made by treating iron with sulfuric acid was mixed with tannin from gallnuts they grow on trees and a thickener when first put to paper this ink is bluish black over time it fades to a dull brown scribes in medieval europe about ad eight zero zero to one five zero zero wrote on sheepskin parchment one one two th century ink recipe called for hawthorn branches to be cut in the spring and left to dry then the bark was pounded from the branches and soaked in water for eight days the water was boiled until it thickened and turned black wine was added during boiling the ink was poured into special bags and hung in the sun once dried the mixture was mixed with wine and iron salt over a fire to make the final ink in the one four th century a new type of ink had to be developed in europe for the printing press two types of ink were prevelent at the time the greek and roman writing ink soot glue and water and the one two th century variety composed of ferrous sulfate nutgall gum and water neither of these handwriting inks could adhere to printing surfaces without creating blurs eventually an oily

indian ink or india ink in american english is a simple black ink once widely used for writing and printing and now more commonly used for drawing especially when inking comics early treatises on the arts refer to black carbon ink that was prepared by the ancient chinese and egyptians the basis of the ink was a black carbon pigment in an aqueous glue or binding medium sometime before the one two th century eraclius in his de coloribus et artibus romanorum presented a set of directions for making several types of carbon inks including one similar to the indian ink of china made from the soot of burning resin or wood different types of wood will create different colored inks in an english volume on handwriting of one five eight one theophilus presented a recipe for a carbon ink to make inke in haste in hast for a shift when ye have a great neede take woll or wollen to stand you in steede which burnt in the fyre the powder beate small with vinegar or water make inke withall as the recipe shows no binder material is necessary the carbon molecules are in colloidal suspension and form a waterproof layer after drying often waterproof shellac is added though indian ink replaced the previously widespread iron gall nut ink in the opening years of the two zero th century caution indian ink is usually not suitable for fountain pens it will readily clog the pen an exception to this is pelikan fount india which does not contain shellac see also pen and ink indian ink can also be used for home made tattoos by drawing on the preferred design and then stabbing over the ink with a

matrix ecm especially in growth cone axon guidance and in signal transduction from the ecm to the cell there are many different types of integrin and many cells have multiple types on their surface integrins are of vital importance to most multicellular organisms from humans to sponges mutations in the genes encoding for integrin can be found in certain types of cancer for instance breast cancer a failure of integrin to anchor a cell to the ecm can play a role in the metastasis of certain cancer cells other types of protein that play a role in cell cell cell matrix interaction and communication are cadherins ncams and selectins structure integrins are obligate heterodimers containing two distinct chains termed the alpha and beta subunits about one eight and eight subunits have been found in addition variants of many of the subunits are formed by differential splicing for example four variants of the beta one subunit exist through different combinations of these alpha and beta subunits some two four unique integrins are generated the subunits each penetrate the plasma membrance and in general have very short cytoplasmic domains within the cell four zero seven zero amino acids the exception being the beta four subunit which has one of the largest known cytoplasmic domains of any membrane protein one zero eight eight amino acids outside the cell plasma membrane the chains lie close together along a length of about two three nm the final five nm of each chain form a ligand binding region for the ecm the molecular mass of the subunits varies from about one zero zero zero zero zero to one four zero zero zero zero in different integrins subunits have four cysteine rich repeated sequences subunits bind several divalent cations x ray crystal structure has been obtained for the complete extracellular regions of one integrin and this shows the molecule to be folded into an inverted v shape which brings the ligand binding sites close to the cell membrane the current hypothesis is that integrin function involves changes in shape to move the ligand binding site into a more accessible position away from the cell surface and this shape change also triggers intracellular signalling function two main functions of integrins are attachment of the cell to the ecm signal transduction from the ecm to the cell however they are also involved in a wide range of other biological activities these include binding of viruses including adenovirus echo viruses hanta viruses foot and mouth disease viruses to cells immune patrolling cell migration attachment of cell to the ecm integrins couple the ecm outside a cell to the cytoskeleton in particular the microfilaments inside the cell which ligand in the ecm the integrin can bind to is mainly decided by which and subunits the integrin is made of among the ligands of integrins are fibronectin collagen and laminin the connection between the cell and the ecm enables the cell to endure pulling forces without being ripped out of the ecm the ability of a cell to create this kind of bond is also of vital importance in ontogeny the connections between integrin and the ligands in the ecm and the microfilaments inside the cell are indirect they are linked via scaffolding proteins like talin paxillin and alpha actinin these act by regulating kinases like fak focal adhesion kinase and src kinase family members to phosphorylate substrates such as p one three zero cas thereby recruiting signaling adaptors such as crk cell attachment to the ecm is a basic requirement to built a multicellular organism integrins are not simply hooks but give the cell critical signals about the nature of its surroundings together with signals arising from receptors for soluble growth factors like vegf egf and many others they enforce a cellular decision on what biological action to take be it attachment movement death or differentiation thus integrins lie at the heart both literally and figuratively of cellular biological processes signal transduction integrins play an important role in cell signaling connection with ecm molecules can cause a signal to be relayed into the cell through protein kinases that are connected with the intracellular end of the integrin molecule the signals the cell receives through the integrin can have relation to cell growth cell division cell survival cellular differentiation apoptosis programmed cell death membrane biology integral membrane proteins cell adhesion proteins another unrelated ion channeling process is part of ion implantation ion channels are pore forming proteins that help establish the small voltage gradient that exists across the membrane of all living cells see cell potential by allowing the flow of ions down their electrochemical gradient they are present in the membranes that surround all biological cells basic features an ion channel is an integral membrane protein or more typically an assembly of several proteins such multi subunit assemblies usually involve a circular arrangement of identical or related proteins closely packed around a water filled pore through the plane of the membrane or lipid bilayer while large pore channels permit the passage of ions more or less indiscriminately the archetypal channel pore is just one or two atoms wide at its narrowest point it conducts a specific species of ion such as sodium or potassium and conveys them through the membrane single file nearly as quickly as the ions move through free fluid in some ion channels access to the pore is governed by a gate which may be opened or closed by chemical or electrical signals temperature or mechanical force depending on the variety of channel biological role because voltage gated channels underlie the nerve impulse and because transmitter gated channels mediate conduction across the synapses channels are especially prominent components of the nervous system indeed most of the offensive and defensive toxins that organisms have evolved for shutting down the nervous systems of predators and prey e g the venoms produced by spiders scorpions snakes fish bees sea snails and others work by plugging ion channel pores but ion channels figure in a wide variety of biological processes that involve rapid changes in cells in the search for new drugs ion channels are a favorite target diversity and activation voltage gated channels open or close depending on the transmembrane potential examples include the sodium and potassium voltage gated channels of nerve and muscle that are involved in the propagation of the action potential and the voltage gated calcium channels that control neurotransmitter release in pre synaptic endings ligand gated channels open in response to a specific ligand molecule on the external face of the membrane in which the channel resides examples include the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ampa receptor and other neurotransmitter gated channels cyclic nucleotide gated channels calcium activated channels and others open in response to internal solutes and mediate cellular responses to second messengers stretch activated channels open or close in response to mechanical forces that arise from local stretching or compression of the membrane around them for example when their cells swell or shrink such channels are believed to underlie touch sensation and the transduction of acoustic vibrations into the sensation of sound g protein gated channels open in response to g protein activation via its receptor inward rectifier k channels allow potassium to flow into the cell in an inwardly rectifying manner i e potassium flows into the cell but not out of the cell they are involved in important physiological processes such as the pacemaker activity in the heart insulin release and potassium uptake in glial cells light gated channels like channelrhodopsin are directly opened by the action of light resting channels remain open at all times certain channels respond to multiple influences for instance the nmda receptor is partially activated by interaction with its ligand glutamate but is also voltage sensitive and conducts only when the membrane is depolarized some calcium sensitive potassium channels respond to both calcium and depolarization with an excess of one apparently being sufficient to overcome an absence of the other detailed structure channels differ with respect to the ion they let pass for example na k cl the ways in which they may be regulated the number of subunits of which they are composed and other aspects of structure channels belonging to the largest class which includes the voltage gated channels that underlie the nerve impulse consists of four subunits with six transmembrane helices each on activation these helices move about and open the pore two of these six helices are separated by a loop that lines the pore and is the primary determinant of ion selectivity and conductance in this channel class and some others the channel subunits of one such other class for example consist of just this p loop and two transmembrane helices the determination of their molecular structure by roderick mackinnon using x ray crystallography won a share of the two zero zero three nobel prize in chemistry because of their small size and the difficulty of crystallizing integral membrane proteins for x ray analysis it is only very recently that scientists have been able to directly examine what channels look like particularly in cases where the crystallography required removing channels from their membranes with detergent many researchers regard images that have been obtained as tentative an example is the long awaited crystal structure of a voltage gated potassium channel which was reported in may two zero zero three one inevitable ambiguity about these structures relates to the strong evidence that channels change conformation as they operate they open and close for example such that the structure in the crystal could represent any one of these operational states most of what researchers have deduced about channel operation so far they have established through electrophysiology biochemistry gene sequence comparison and mutagenesis diseases of ion channels there are a number of chemicals and genetic disorders which disrupt normal functioning of ion channels and have disastrous consequences for the

voltage dependent sodium channels conotoxin which is used by cone snails to hunt prey lidocaine and novocaine belong to a class of local anesthetics which block sodium ion channels dendrotoxin is produced by a mamba snakes which blocks potassium channels genetic shaker gene mutations cause a defect in the volatage gated ion channels slowing down the repolarization of the cell equine

british biophysicists alan hodgkin and andrew huxley as part of their nobel prize winning theory of the nerve impulse published in one nine five two the existence of ion channels was confirmed in the one nine seven zero s with an electrical recording technique known as the patch clamp which led to a nobel prize to erwin neher and bert sakmann the technique s inventors hundreds if not thousands of

samuel krafsur mentioned in the venona decryptions see also idde an integrated development environment ide also known as integrated design environment and integrated debugging environment is a type of computer software that assists computer programmers to develop software ides normally consist of a source code editor a compiler and or interpreter build automation tools and usually a debugger sometimes a version control system and various tools to simplify the construction of a gui are integrated as well many modern ides also integrate a class browser an object inspector and a class hierarchy diagram for use with object oriented software development although some multiple language ides are in use such as the eclipse ide netbeans or microsoft visual studio typically an ide is devoted to a specific programming language as in the visual basic ide history ides initially became necessary when doing development in front of console or terminal early languages did not have one since they were prepared using flowcharts coding forms and keypunches before being submitted to a compiler basic was the first language to be created with an ide and was also the first to be designed for use while sitting in front of a console or terminal its ide part of the dartmouth time sharing system was command based and therefore didn t look much like the menu driven graphical ides of today however it seamlessly integrated editing file management compilation debugging and execution in the manner characteristic of modern ide today the term ide is a contrast to unrelated command line tools such as vi emacs or make while one could think of unix as an ide most developers think of an ide as being or having the appearance of a single program in which all development is done this program provides typically large numbers of features for authoring modifying compiling deploying and debugging software the idea being that the ide abstracts the configuration necessary to piece together command line utilities in a cohesive unit which theoretically reduces the time to learn a language and increases developer productivity it is also thought that the tight integration of various development tasks can lead to further productivity increases for example code can be compiled while being written providing instant feedback on syntax errors while most modern ides are graphical ides in use before the advent of windowing systems such as microsoft windows or x one one were text based using function keys or hotkeys to perform various tasks turbo pascal is a common example an interesting development is the emergence and popularization of open source ide such as eclipse and netbeans in recent years the combination of the open source philosophy with an open extensible framework encourages the creation of a community of people to extend the capabilities of the ide allowing even exotic languages and applications to be supported by the environment visual programming there is also growing interest in visual programming not to be confused with visual basic or visual c these ides allow users to create new applications by moving programming building blocks or code nodes to create flowcharts or structure diagrams which are then compiled or interpreted these flowcharts often are based on the unified modeling language this interface has been popularized with the lego mindstorms system and is being actively pursued by a number of companies wishing to capitalize on the power of custom browsers like those found at mozilla and the power of distributed programming cf labview software one of the first visual programming systems max was modelled after analog synthesizer design and has been used to develop real time music performance software since the one nine eight zero s this approach is also used in specialist software such as openlab where the end users want the flexibility of a full programming language without the traditional learning curve associated with one a semi free and open source alternative is the visual programing language mindscript with extended functionallity for cryptology interfacing databases etc arguments many linux programmers argue that the existing command line gnu tools are in themselves an ide though with a different style of interface and under the linux environment many programmers still use makefiles and their derivatives but even on linux graphical ides are becoming increasingly popular although almost all of them are built on top of the text based utilities which makes them more compatible with each other somehow linux programs that use the standard gnu tools are easily ported to other operating systems including windows and mac os x because most of these tools have been ported using cygwin or some other method like mingw on windows similarly many linux programmers use emacs or vim an advanced text editor that seeks to provide the power of the unix editor vi which integrates support for many of the standard unix linux build tools in what its users believe is an extremely elegant manner data display debugger is intended to be an advanced graphical front end for many text based debugger standard tools even if emacs itself has many plug ins for debugging under windows command line tools for development are not well known probably because windows emphasises a graphical approach as a result there are multiple commercial and non commercial solutions but each of them has a different design and as a result they tend to have compatibility problems that said all the major compiler vendors for windows provide free copies of their command line tools including microsoft visual c free version platform sdk microsoft net framework sdk nmake utility borland bcc three two compiler make

both stage and screen his roles have spanned genres from serious shakespearean and modern theatre to popular action movies he is also known as an activist for the gay rightss of gays and lesbians youth and early career mckellen was born in burnley lancashire england shortly before the outbreak of world war ii and has indicated that this had some impact on him in an interview with the advocate magazine december two five two zero zero one when an interviewer remarked that he seemed quite calm in the aftermath of the september one one terrorist attack he said well darling you forget i slept under a steel plate during the battle of britain until i was four years old quotes in this article are from the advocate interview unless otherwise noted mckellen s father denis murray mckellen a civil engineer was a lay preacher and both of his grandfathers were preachers as well his home environment was strongly christian but non orthodox my upbringing was of low nonconformist christians who felt that you led the christian life in part by behaving in a christian manner to everybody you met when he was one two his mother margery lois mckellen n e sutcliffe died his father died when he was two four when he came out of the closet to his stepmother gladys mckellen who was a friend quaker not only was she not fazed but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people s sexuality years back i think she was just glad for my sake that i wasn t lying any more mckellen s acting career started while he was still a boy he won a scholarship to st catharine s college university of cambridge when he was one eight where he developed an intense crush on derek jacobi he has characterized it as a passion that was undeclared and unrequited mckellen made his stage d but in coventry in one nine six one and his west end d but in one nine six four he was already a major name in the theatre before establishing himself as a television and film actor he and his first serious partner brian taylor began their relationship in one nine six four it was a relationship that was to last for eight years ending in one nine seven two they lived in london where mckellen continued to pursue his career as an actor for over a decade he has lived in a five story victorian conversion in narrow street limehouse london first major stage roles the role that made mckellen famous was his one nine six nine portrayal of king edward ii of england in the prospect theatre company s touring production of marlowe s edward ii the production was controversial for its explicit torture scenes and implicit homosexuality he later reprised the role for the bbc in one nine seven two he founded the actors company with his friend edward petherbridge and this was the beginning of his reputation as a spokesman for actors and the british theatre in general between one nine seven four and one nine seven eight he enhanced his reputation with leading roles in royal shakespeare company productions such as romeo and juliet in which he played opposite francesca annis and macbeth opposite judi dench in one nine seven eight he met his second lover sean mathias at the edinburgh festival according to mathias the love affair was tempestuous with conflicts over mckellen s success in acting versus mathias somewhat less successful career mathias said that in those days the world was far more homophobic and me being the young pretty boy people wouldn t take me seriously as an actor being ian s boyfriend mathias was two two when they met mckellen three nine however mathias also says mckellen did nothing but help me in his career award winning successes mckellen starred on broadway in bent a play about gay men in nazi death camps starting in one nine seven nine despite his role in this ground breaking play which brought to public view for the first time in a widespread way the persecution of gay people in nazi germany mckellen was not yet out publicly at first he was unsure whether he dared to take the role as impressed as i was by it i thought my god do i dare be in this and sean read it and said well you have to do it he said bent proved to be of great significance to mckellen since starring in the original broadway production of bent he has been involved in two other productions of the play in one nine nine zero he starred in the revival at the national theatre in london directed by mathias and also made a supporting appearance in the movie version also directed by mathias which was released in one nine nine seven mckellen s talents won him successively more important and visible parts until eventually in one nine eight zero he won the role of salieri in the broadway production of amadeus he was awarded the tony award for his performance the most prestigious award given to actors in live theatre in the united states his appearance as walter a mentally retarded adult in a one nine eight two television play won him a new following but he was still a relative unknown to much of the u s public in the one nine nine zero s mckellen began to branch into major american film and television roles in one nine nine three mckellen had a supporting role as a south african tycoon in the sleeper hit six degrees of separation in which he starred with stockard channing donald sutherland and will smith in the same year he was also exposed to north american audiences in minor roles in the television miniseries tales of the city based on the novel by his friend armistead maupin and the movie last action hero in which he played death also

performance was critically acclaimed and he was nominated for golden globe and bafta awards and won the european film award for best actor his breakthrough role for mainstream american audiences came with the modestly acclaimed apt pupil based on a story by stephen king mckellen portrayed an old nazi officer living under a false name in the u s who was befriended by a curious teenager brad renfro who threatened to expose him unless he told his story in detail queen elizabeth ii appointed him a cbe in one nine seven nine and knighted him in one nine nine zero for his outstanding work and contributions to the theatre becoming sir ian mckellen in one nine nine four mckellen put together a one man show a knight out the show was very successful and he still performs it today he considers it a perpetual work in progress sir ian mckellen played the wizard gandalf in the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring for which he earned an academy award nomination he was nominated for the academy award for best actor for his role in the one nine nine eight film gods and monsters where he played james whale gay director of show boat one nine three six and frankenstein more recently mckellen has become a major global star by playing leading roles in blockbuster films first he played magneto in x men and its sequel x two he followed that performance with the role of gandalf in the three films that comprise the screen adaptation of the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring the two towers and the return of the king for the fellowship of the ring he was nominated for the academy award for best supporting actor he will reprise the role of magneto in the upcoming two zero zero six sequel x men the last stand in april and may two zero zero five he played the role of mel hutchwright in granada television s long running soap opera coronation street work for gay rights while mckellen was always out to his co actors his public persona was another matter it was not until one nine eight eight that he came out to the general public a controversial amendment was under consideration in the united kingdom parliament section two eight of the local government bill proposed to prohibit local authorities from promoting homosexuality as a kind of pretended family relationship the drafting was open to several interpretations and the actual impact of the amendment was uncertain mckellen became active in fighting the proposed law and declared himself gay in a debate with the conservative journalist peregrine worsthorne which was aired by the bbc my own participating in that campaign was a focus for people to take comfort that if ian mckellen was on board for this perhaps it would be all right for other people to be as well gay and straight he said section two eight was however enacted and remained on the statute books until two zero zero three mckellen continued to fight for its repeal and criticised british prime minister tony blair for failing to concern himself with the issue sir ian mckellen with michael cashman at the gay rights march on manchester in protest of section two eight in one nine eight eight by the time he came out mckellen s ten year relationship with mathias had also ended he has stated that being free of the additional concern of what effect his coming out would have on his partner s career made the choice easier as did the advice and support of his friends among them noted gay author armistead maupin in one nine nine four he made a bit of a splash at the closing ceremony of the gay games where he stood before a crowd of gay athletes and their supporters and fans to say i m sir ian mckellen but you can call me serena this nickname had been circulating within the gay community since mckellen s knighthood was conferred mckellen has continued up to the present to be very active in gay rights efforts he is a co founder of stonewall a gay rights lobby group in the united kingdom the group is named after the stonewall

film series actors vegetarians x men actors the intellivision is a video game console released by mattel in one nine eight zero development of the console began in one nine seven eight less than a year after the introduction of its main competitor the legendary atari two six zero zero aka the atari vcs rapid popularity the intellivision was developed by mattel electronics a subsidiary of mattel formed expressly for the development of electronic games the console was test marketed in fresno california in one nine seven nine with a total of four games available and went nationwide in one nine eight zero with a price tag of two nine nine and a pack in game las vegas blackjack though not the first system to challenge atari systems from fairchild semiconductor bally and magnavox were already on the market it was the first to pose a serious threat to atari s dominance a series of ads featuring george plimpton were produced which mercilessly attacked the atari two six zero zero s lesser capabilities with side by side game comparisons one of the slogans of the television advertisements stated that intellivision was the closest thing to the real thing one example in an advertisement compared golf games the others had a blip sound and cruder graphics while intellivision featured a realistic swing sound and striking of the ball and graphics that suggested a more three d look although undoubtedly crude when compared with modern game consoles like atari mattel marketed their console to a number of retailers as a rebadged unit these models include the radio shack tandyvision the gte sylvania intellivision and the sears super video arcade the sears model was a particular coup for mattel as sears was already selling a rebadged atari two six zero zero unit and in doing so making a huge contribution to atari s success in that first year mattel sold one seven five zero zero zero intellivision consoles and the library grew to one nine games at this point in time all intellivision games were developed by an outside firm aph the company recognized that what had been seen as a secondary product line might be a big business realizing that potential profits are much greater with first party software mattel formed its own in house software development group the original five members of that intellivision team were manager gabriel baum don daglow rick levine mike minkoff and john sohl levine and minkoff a long time mattel toys veteran both came over from the hand held mattel games engineering team to keep these programmers from being hired away by rival atari their identity and work location was kept a closely guarded secret in public the programmers were referred to collectively as the blue sky rangers by one nine eight two sales were soaring over two million intellivision consoles had been sold by the end of the year earning mattel a one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero profit this was a big year for mattel third party atari developers activision and imagic began releasing games for the intellivision as did hardware rivals atari and colecovision mattel created m network branded games for atari and coleco s systems the most popular titles sold over a million units each the original five person mattel game development team had grown to one one zero people under now vice president baum while daglow led intellivision development and top engineer minkoff directed all work on all other platforms keyboard component many users waited patiently for the promised release of the keyboard component an add on computer upgrade unit touted by mattel as coming soon even when the original console was first shipped the unit featured a built in cassette tape drive for loading and saving data the keyboard component would plug into the cartridge slot on the intellivision and had an additional cartridge slot of its own to allow regular intellivision games to be played in the usual way the upgrade had proven too expensive to develop and produce so mattel had repeatedly sent the engineers back to the drawing board to attempt to increase reliability and reduce cost mattel was subsequently investigated by the federal trade commission ftc for failing to produce the promised upgrade and eventually ordered to pay one zero zero zero zero a day about two five zero zero zero in two zero zero five when adjusted for inflation until it was released finally mattel offered the keyboard component for sale via mail order four thousand units were sold many were later returned for a full refund when mattel recalled the unit in one nine eight three due to various support problems especially that the then innovative cassette tape unit never proved to be reliable according to the blue sky rangers web site users who opted to keep theirs were made to sign a waiver absolving intellivision of all future responsibility for technical support in addition the keyboard component could be modified into a development platform for the intellivision and such units were used internally for game development during the latter portion of the system s lifespan by this time mattel had set up competing internal engineering teams each trying to either fix the keyboard component or replace it the rival mattel engineers had come up with a much less expensive keyboard alternative the entertainment computer system ecs was much smaller sleeker and easier to produce than the original keyboard component unfortunately while the original keyboard component had some advantages over the small computers of its day the new keyboard component was designed to be inexpensive not functional and was far less powerful than emerging machines like the commodore six four the two keyboard units were incompatible but owners of the older unit were offered a new ecs to maintain secrecy in a toy industry where industrial espionage was a way of life many projects had code names so documents and casual discussion did not reveal company secrets with the video games business already staggering by the time the new keyboard component was planned daglow suggested the new device be code named lucki for low user cost keyboard interface the name stuck but the good fortune did not the cheaply manufactured ecs keyboard add on was a retail failure intellivoice intellivision ii featuring the game burger time and the voice synthesis module in one nine eight three mattel introduced a new peripheral innovative for the time intellivoice a voice synthesis device which produced speech when used with certain games most of which would not work without the add on component top mattel programmers including bill fisher steve roney gene smith and john sohl were diverted to the project slowing the previous initiative to counter atari with new arcade style games voice titles included bomb squad b one seven bomber intellivision world series baseball intellivoice optional since the game already required the ecs keyboard space spartans tron solar sailer intellivision ii in addition to the intellivoice module one nine eight three also saw the introduction of a redesigned model called the intellivision ii featuring detachable controllers and sleeker case the system changer which played atari two six zero zero games on the intellivision ii and a music keyboard add on for the ecs like the ecs intellivision ii was designed first and foremost to be inexpensive to manufacture among other things the raised bubble keypad of the original hand controller was replaced by a flat membrane keyboard surface unfortunately many intellivision games had been designed for users to play by feeling the buttons without looking down and many games were far less playable on intellivision ii competition and market crash see also video game crash of one nine eight three amid the flurry of new hardware there was trouble for the intellivision new game systems colecovision atari five two zero zero and vectrex all in one nine eight two were further subdividing the market and the videogame crash began to put pressure on the entire industry the intellivision team rushed to finish a major new round of games including burger time and the ultra secret three d glasses game hover force unfortunately although burger time was one of the best games on the intellivision and was programmed by blue sky ranger ray kaestner in record time the five month manufacturing cycle meant that the game did not appear until the late spring of one nine eight three after the video game crash had severely damaged game sales in the spring of one nine eight three mattel went from aggressively hiring game programmers to laying them off within a two week period by august there were massive layoffs and the price of the intellivision ii which launched at one five zero earlier that year was lowered to six nine mattel electronics posted a three zero zero million loss early in one nine eight four the division was closed the first high profile victim of the crash intellivision game sales continued when a liquidator purchased all rights to the intellivision and its software from mattel as well as all remaining inventory after much of the existing software inventory had been sold former mattel marketing executive terry valeski bought all rights to intellivision and started a new venture the new company intv corp continued to sell old stock via retail and mail order when the old stock of intellivision ii consoles ran out they introduced a new console dubbed intv iii this unit was actually a cosmetic rebadge of the original intellivision console this unit was later renamed the super pro system in addition to manufacturing new consoles intv corp also continued to develop new games releasing a few new titles each year eventually the system was discontinued in one nine nine one intellivision games became readily available again when keith robinson an early intellivision programmer responsible for the game tron solar sailer purchased the software rights and founded a new company intellivision productions as a result games originally designed for the intellivision are available on modern day consoles including the playstation two xbox nintendo gamecube and nintendo ds in the intellivision lives package statistics over three million intellivision consoles were sold during its one two year run there were a total of one two five intellivision games released innovations intellivision was the first one six bit game console though some people have mistakenly referred to it as a one zero bit system because the cpu s instruction set and game cartridges are one zero bits wide a one zero bit chunk of data is called a decle the registers in the microprocessor where the mathematical logic is processed were one six bits wide the intellivision was also the first system to feature downloadable games though without a storage device the games vanished once the machine was turned off in one nine eight one general instrument manufacturer of the intellivision s cpu teamed up with mattel to roll out the playcable a device that allowed the downloading of intellivision games via cable tv intellivision was the second game console to provide real time human and robot voices in the middle of gameplay courtesy of the intellivoice module the first was magnavox s voice module for the odyssey two intellivision world series baseball designed by don daglow and eddie dombrower and released in one nine eight three was the first video game to use the concept of displaying the action in simulated three d through camera angles that emulated those used in tv sports coverage prior games always showed a single fixed or scrolling camera view of the field daglow and dombrower went on to create the earl weaver baseball games at electronic arts in one nine eight seven it was also the first console to feature a controller with a directional pad that allowed one six directions which was handy for sports games however the ergonomics of the disc shaped pad and particularly the action buttons on the side of the controller were poor this turned off some gamers along with cost this was one of the factors in making the intellivision less popular than the atari two six zero zero however it is interesting to note that the method of controlling movement on the intellivision with the thumb is not too different from the popular home video game controllers we see now from the nes to today the joystick style controller is much more rare on modern consoles trivia during the early eight zero s new york based television station wpix ran a very popular telephone interactive game called tv pixx the pixx being derived from the tv station s call letters it was aired during the traditional weekday afternoon slot of children s programming as an interlude during whatever show was being aired participants would be called at home to play a videogame that appeared on their screen two of the earliest games featured on the segment were simple games such as tic tac toe and a breakout type game called moving target intellivision s football baseball basketball and space battle were later featured as the tv segment got more popular participants would say the word pixx in order to affect a game action such as passing the ball swinging the bat or firing the laser based on the score kids could win prizes such as t shirts and one zero dollar u s savings bonds they could double their prize or win a bonus prize such as advance tickets to see upcoming films by answering a trivia question for a chance at playing kids could send a postcard with their name address and phone number to tv pixx c o wpix tv new york ny tv pixx lasted until one nine eight two when the intellivision system became a popular home game system but for many new york viewers this tv segment was their first glimpse of the intellivison home game system a similar syndicated show ran in the los angeles area at the same time with callers saying pow to interface with the system the show was sabotaged by prank callers calling in to the station after telling an operator the call was an emergency which caused the operator to interrupt the live program with a i have an emergency call for five five five one two one two message intellivision is short for intelligent television screenshots image intv armor battle

from solid rubber side buttons to plastic ones with a hollow center leaving a rectangular imprint on players thumbs and causing pain after even short periods of play the change was apparently made to fractionally reduce the materials cost of the units and was never play tested for usability due to the rush to bring the system to market in the early days of the video game crash of one nine eight

list of intellivision games second generation video game consoles intelligent design id is the concept that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause not an undirected process such as natural selection its leading proponents all of whom are affiliated with the discovery institute say that intelligent design is a scientific theory that stands on equal footing with or is superior to current scientific theories regarding the origin of life an overwhelming majority of the scientific community views intelligent design not as a valid scientific theory but as pseudoscience or junk science the u s national academy of sciences has stated that intelligent design and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life are not science because they cannot be tested by experiment do not generate any predictions and propose no new hypotheses of their own united states federal courts have ruled as unconstitutional a public school district requirement endorsing intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in science classes on the grounds that its inclusion violates the establishment clause of the first amendment in kitzmiller v dover area school district two zero zero five united states federal court judge john e jones iii ruled that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature intelligent design in summary intelligent design is presented as an alternative to purely naturalistic explanations for evolution the stated purpose is to investigate whether or not existing empirical evidence implies that life on earth must have been designed by an intelligent agent or agents william dembski one of intelligent design s leading proponents has stated that the fundamental claim of intelligent design is that there are natural systems that cannot be adequately explained in terms of undirected natural forces and that exhibit features which in any other circumstance we would attribute to intelligence proponents of intelligent design look for evidence of what they term signs of intelligence physical properties of an object that they assert necessitate design the most commonly cited signs include irreducible complexity information mechanisms and specified complexity design proponents argue that living systems show one or more of these from which they infer that some aspects of life have been designed this stands in opposition to mainstream biological science which relies on experiment and collection of uncontested data to explain the natural world exclusively through observed impersonal physical processes such as mutations and natural selection intelligent design proponents say that while evidence pointing to the nature of an intelligent cause or agent may not be directly observable its effects on nature can be detected dembski in signs of intelligence states proponents of intelligent design regard it as a scientific research program that investigates the effects of intelligent causes note that intelligent design studies the effects of intelligent causes and not intelligent causes per se in his view one cannot test for the identity of influences exterior to a closed system from within so questions concerning the identity of a designer fall outside the realm of the concept origins of the concept for millennia philosophers have argued that the complexity of nature indicates the existence of a purposeful natural or supernatural designer creator the first recorded arguments for a natural designer come from greek philosophy the philosophical concept of the logos is typically credited to heraclitus c five three five c four seven five bce a pre socratic philosopher and is briefly explained in his extant fragments plato c four two seven c three four seven bce posited a natural demiurge of supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the cosmos in his work timaeus aristotle c three eight four three two two bce also developed the idea of a natural creator of the cosmos often referred to as the prime mover in his work metaphysics in his de natura deorum on the nature of the gods cicero c one zero six c four three bce stated the divine power is to be found in a principle of reason which pervades the whole of nature the use of this line of reasoning as applied to a supernatural designer has come to be known as the teleological argument for the existence of god the most notable forms of this argument were expressed by thomas aquinas in his summa theologiae thirteenth century design being the fifth of aquinas five proofs for god s existence and william paley in his book natural theology one eight zero two where he uses the watchmaker analogy which is still used in intelligent design arguments in the early one nine th century such arguments led to the development of what was called natural theology the study of biology as a search to understand the mind of god this movement fueled the passion for collecting fossils and other biological specimens that ultimately led to darwin s theory of the origin of species intelligent design in the late two zero th century can be seen as a modern reframing of natural theology as evolutionary theory has expanded to explain more phenomena so the examples held up as evidence of design have changed but the essential argument remains the same complex systems imply a designer in the past examples that have been offered included the eye optical system and the feathered wing current examples are mostly biochemical protein functions blood clotting and bacteria flagella see irreducible complexity intelligent design deliberately does not try to identify or name the specific agent of creation it merely states that one or more must exist while intelligent design itself does not name the designer the personal view of many proponents is that the designer is the christian god whether this was a genuine feature of the concept or just a posture taken to avoid alienating those who would separate religion from science teaching has been a matter of great debate between supporters and critics of intelligent design the kitzmiller v dover area school district court ruling held the latter to be the case origins of the term though unrelated to the current use of the term the phrase intelligent design can be found in an one eight four seven issue of scientific american in an one eight six eight geography textbook and in an address to the one eight seven three annual meeting of the british association for the advancement of science by paleyite botanist george james allman no physical hypothesis founded on any indisputable fact has yet explained the origin of the primordial protoplasm and above all of its marvellous properties which render evolution possible in heredity and in adaptability for these properties are the cause and not the effect of evolution for the cause of this cause we have sought in vain among the physical forces which surround us until we are at last compelled to rest upon an independent volition a far seeing intelligent design the phrase was coined again in humanism a one nine zero three book by ferdinand canning scott schiller it will not be possible to rule out the supposition that the process of evolution may be guided by an intelligent design and was resurrected in the early one nine eight zero s by sir fred hoyle as part of his promotion of panspermia the term was again resurrected when the supreme court of the united states in the case of edwards v aguillard one nine eight seven ruled that creationism is unconstitutional in public school science curricula stephen c meyer cofounder of the discovery institute and vice president of the center for science and culture reports that the term came up in one nine eight eight at a conference he attended in tacoma washington called sources of information content in dna he attributes the phrase to charles thaxton editor of of pandas and people in drafts of the book of pandas and people the word creationism was subsequently changed almost without exception to intelligent design the book was published in one nine eight nine and is considered to be the first intelligent design book the term was promoted more broadly by the retired legal scholar phillip e johnson following his one nine nine one book darwin on trial which advocated redefining science to allow claims of supernatural creation johnson considered the father of the intelligent design movement went on to work with meyer becoming the program advisor of the center for science and culture in forming and executing the wedge strategy concepts the following are summaries of key concepts of intelligent design followed by summaries of criticisms counter arguments against such criticisms are often proffered by intelligent design proponents as are counter counter arguments by critics etc irreducible complexity in the context of intelligent design irreducible complexity was put forth by michael behe who defines it as a single system which is composed of several well matched interacting parts that contribute to the basic function wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning behe molecular machines experimental support for the design inference behe uses the mousetrap as an illustrative example of this concept a mousetrap consists of several interacting pieces the base the catch the spring the hammer all of which must be in place for the mousetrap to work the removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap intelligent design advocates assert that natural selection could not create irreducibly complex systems because the selectable function is only present when all parts are assembled behe s original examples of alleged irreducibly complex biological mechanisms also include the bacterial flagellum of e coli the blood clotting cascade cilia and the adaptive immune system critics point out that the irreducible complexity argument assumes that the necessary parts of a system have always been necessary and therefore could not have been added sequentially they argue that something which is at first merely advantageous can later become necessary as other components change furthermore they argue that evolution often proceeds by altering preexisting parts or by removing them from a system instead of by adding them this is sometimes referred to as the scaffolding objection by an analogy with scaffolding which can support a irreducibly complex building until it is complete and able to stand on its own specified complexity the intelligent design concept of specified complexity was developed by mathematician philosopher and theologian william dembski dembski states that when something exhibits specified complexity i e is both complex and specified simultaneously one can infer that it was produced by an intelligent cause i e that it was designed rather than being the result of natural processes he provides the following examples a single letter of the alphabet is specified without being complex a long sentence of random letters is complex without being specified a shakespearean sonnet is both complex and specified he states that details of living things can be similarly characterized especially the patterns of molecular sequences in functional biological molecules such as dna dembski defines complex specified information as anything with a less than one in one zero one five zero chance of occurring by natural chance critics say that this renders the argument a tautology complex specified information csi cannot occur naturally because dembski has defined it thus so the real question becomes whether or not csi actually exists in nature the conceptual soundness of dembski s specified complexity csi argument is strongly disputed by the scientific community specified complexity has yet to be shown to have wide applications in other fields as dembski claims john wilkins and wesley elsberry characterize dembski s explanatory filter as eliminative because it eliminates explanations sequentially first regularity then chance finally defaulting to design they argue that this procedure is flawed as a model for scientific inference because the asymmetric way it treats the different possible explanations renders it prone to making false conclusions of design fine tuned universe one of the arguments of intelligent design proponents that includes more than just biology is that we live in a fine tuned universe with many features that make life possible that cannot be attributed to chance these features include the values of physical constants the strength of nuclear forces and many others intelligent design proponent and center for science and culture fellow guillermo gonzalez argues that if any of these values were even slightly different the universe would be dramatically different with many chemical elements and features of the universe like galaxies being impossible to form thus they argue an intelligent designer of life was needed to ensure that the requisite features were present to achieve that particular outcome other scientists respond that the argument cannot be tested is not quantifiable and is poorly supported by existing evidence critics of both intelligent design and the weak form of anthropic principle argue that they are essentially a tautology in their view these arguments amount to the claim that life is able to exist because the universe is able to support life the claim of the improbability of a life supporting universe has also been criticized as an argument by lack of imagination for assuming no other forms of life are possible life as we know it may not exist if things were different but a different sort of life might exist in its place they also suggest that many of the stated variables appear to be interconnected and that calculations made by mathematicians and physicists suggest that the emergence of a universe similar to ours is quite probable the designer or designers intelligent design arguments are formulated in secular terms and intentionally avoid identifying the intelligent agent they posit they do not state that god is the designer but the designer is often implicitly hypothesized to have intervened in a way that only a god could intervene intelligent design proponents such as dembski have implied that an alien culture could fulfill these requirements but since the authoritative description of intelligent design explicitly states that the universe displays features of having been designed dembski concludes that no intelligent agent who is strictly physical could have presided over the origin of the universe or the origin of life furthermore the leading proponents have made statements to their supporters that they believe the designer to be the christian god to the exclusion of all other religions and thus there exists a well established link to genesis and creationism critics argue that existing evidence makes the design hypothesis appear unlikely for example jerry coyne of the university of chicago asks why a designer would give us a pathway for making vitamin c but then destroy it by disabling one of its enzymes and why he or she wouldn t stock oceanic islands with reptiles mammals amphibians and freshwater fish despite the suitability of such islands for these species critics of intelligent design point to the fact that the flora and fauna on those islands resemble that of the nearest mainland even when the environments are very different as evidence that species were not placed there by a designer behe argued in darwin s black box that we are simply incapable of understanding the designer s motives so such questions cannot be answered definitively odd designs could for example have been placed there by the designer for artistic reasons to show off for some as yet undetectable practical purpose or for some unguessable reason coyne responds that in light of the evidence either life resulted not from intelligent design but from evolution or the intelligent designer is a cosmic prankster who designed everything to make it look as though it had evolved asserting the need for a designer of complexity also raises the question what designed the designer intelligent design proponents say that the question is irrelevant to or outside the scope of intelligent design but richard wein counters that the unanswered questions a theory creates must be balanced against the improvements in our understanding which the explanation provides invoking an unexplained being to explain the origin of other beings ourselves is little more than question begging the new question raised by the explanation is as problematic as the question which the explanation purports to answer critics see the claim that the designer need not be explained not as a contribution to knowledge but as a thought terminating clich answering what designed the designer leads to an infinite regression from which intelligent design proponents can only escape by resorting to religious creationism or logical contradiction intelligent design as a movement time magazine cover august one five two zero zero five the intelligent design movement arose out of an organized neocreationist campaign directed by the discovery institute to promote a religious agenda calling for broad social academic and political changes employing intelligent design arguments in the public sphere primarily in the united states leaders of the movement say intelligent design exposes the limitations of scientific orthodoxy and of the secular philosophy of naturalism intelligent design proponents allege that science shouldn t be limited to naturalism and shouldn t demand the adoption of a naturalistic philosophy that dismisses any explanation that contains a supernatural cause out of hand phillip e johnson considered the father of the intelligent design movement stated that the goal of intelligent design is to cast creationism as a scientific concept all leading intelligent design proponents are fellows or staff of the discovery institute and its center for science and culture nearly all intelligent design concepts and the associated movement are the products of the discovery institute which guides the movement and follows its wedge strategy while conducting its adjunct teach the controversy campaign leading intelligent design proponents have made conflicting statements regarding intelligent design in statements directed at the general public they state that intelligent design is not religious while they state that intelligent design has its foundation in the bible when addressing conservative christian supporters barbara forrest an expert who has written extensively on the movement describes this as being due to the discovery institute obfuscating its agenda as a matter of policy she has written that the movement s activities betray an aggressive systematic agenda for promoting not only intelligent design creationism but the religious world view that undergirds it religion and leading proponents intelligent design arguments are carefully formulated in secular terms and intentionally avoid positing the identity of the designer phillip e johnson has stated that cultivating ambiguity by employing secular language in arguments which are carefully crafted to avoid overtones of theistic creationism is a necessary first step for ultimately reintroducing the christian concept of god as the designer johnson emphasizes the first thing that has to be done is to get the bible out of the discussion and that after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact only then can biblical issues be discussed johnson explicitly calls for intelligent design proponents to obfuscate their religious motivations so as to avoid having intelligent design identified as just another way of packaging the christian evangelical message the principal intelligent design advocates including michael behe william dembski jonathan wells actually a member of the unification church headed by reverend moon and stephen c meyer are christians and have stated that in their view the designer of life is god the vast majority of leading intelligent design proponents are evangelical protestants the conflicting claims made by leading intelligent design advocates as to whether or not intelligent design is rooted in religious conviction are the result of their strategy for example william dembski in his book the design inference lists a god or an alien life force as two possible options for the identity of the designer however in his book intelligent design the bridge between science and theology dembski states that christ is indispensable to any scientific theory even if its practitioners don t have a clue about him the pragmatics of a scientific theory can to be sure be pursued without recourse to christ but the conceptual soundness of the theory can in the end only be located in christ dembski also stated id is part of god s general revelation not only does intelligent design rid us of this ideology materialism which suffocates the human spirit but in my personal experience i ve found that it opens the path for people to come to christ the two leading intelligent design proponents phillip johnson and william dembski cite the bible s book of john as the foundation of intelligent design barbara forrest contends that such statements reveal that leading proponents see intelligent design as essentially religious in nature as opposed to a scientific concept that has implications with which their personal religious beliefs happen to coincide intelligent design controversy a key strategy of the intelligent design movement is in convincing the general public that there is a debate among scientists about whether life evolved seeking to convince the public politicians and cultural leaders that schools should teach the controversy however there is no such controversy the scientific consensus is that life evolved the intelligent design controversy centers on three issues whether the definition of science is broad enough to allow for theories of origins which incorporate the acts of an intelligent designer whether the evidence supports such theories whether the teaching of such theories is appropriate and legal in public education natural science uses the scientific method to create a posteriori knowledge based on observation alone sometimes called empirical science intelligent design proponents seek to change this definition by eliminating methodological naturalism from science and replacing it with what the leader of the intelligent design movement phillip e johnson calls theistic realism and what critics call methodological supernaturalism which means belief in a transcendent non natural dimension of reality inhabited by a transcendent non natural deity intelligent design proponents argue that naturalistic explanations fail to explain certain phenomena and that supernatural explanations provide a very simple and intuitive explanation for the origins of life and the universe proponents say that evidence exists in the forms of irreducible complexity and specified complexity that cannot be explained by natural processes supporters also hold that religious neutrality requires the teaching of both evolution and intelligent design in schools saying that teaching only evolution unfairly discriminates against those holding creationist beliefs teaching both intelligent design supporters argue allows for the possibility of religious belief without causing the state to actually promote such beliefs many intelligent design followers believe that scientism is itself a religion that promotes secularism and materialism in an attempt to erase theism from public life and view their work in the promotion of intelligent design as a way to return religion to a central role in education and other public spheres some allege that this larger debate is often the subtext for arguments made over intelligent design though others note that intelligent design serves as an effective proxy for the religious beliefs of prominent intelligent design proponents in their efforts to advance their religious point of view within society according to critics intelligent design has not presented a credible scientific case and is an attempt to teach religion in public schools which the united states constitution forbids under the establishment clause they allege that intelligent design has substituted public support for scientific research furthermore if one were to take the proponents of equal time for all theories at their word there would be no logical limit to the number of potential theories to be taught in the public school system including admittedly silly ones like the flying spaghetti monster theory there are innumerable mutually incompatible supernatural explanations for complexity and intelligent design does not provide a mechanism for discriminating among them furthermore intelligent design is neither observable nor repeatable which critics argue violates the scientific requirement of falsifiability indeed intelligent design proponent michael behe concedes you can t prove intelligent design by experiment even though evolution theory does not explain abiogenesis the generation of life from nonliving matter intelligent design proponents cannot infer that an intelligent designer is behind the part of the process that is not understood scientifically since they have not shown that anything supernatural has occurred the inference that an intelligent designer a god or an alien life force created life on earth has been compared to the a priori claim that aliens helped the ancient egyptians build the pyramids in both cases the effect of this outside intelligence is not repeatable observable or falsifiable and it violates occam s razor from a strictly empirical standpoint one may list what is known about egyptian construction techniques but must admit ignorance about exactly how the egyptians built the pyramids many religious people do not condone the teaching of what is considered unscientific or questionable material and support theistic evolution which does not conflict with scientific theories an example is cardinal sch nborn who sees purpose and design in the natural world yet has no difficulty with the theory of evolution within the borders of scientific theory can intelligent design be defined as science the scientific method is based on an approach known as methodological naturalism to study and explain the natural world without assuming the existence or nonexistence of the supernatural intelligent design proponents have often said that their position is not only scientific but that it is even more scientific than evolution and want a redefinition of science to allow non naturalistic theories such as intelligent design this presents a demarcation problem which in the philosophy of science is about how and where to draw the lines around science for a theory to qualify as scientific it must be consistent internally and externally parsimonious sparing in proposed entities or explanations see occam s razor useful describes and explains observed phenomena empirically testable and if it meets only a couple or none at all then it cannot be treated as scientific in any meaningful sense of the word typical objections to defining intelligent design as science are that it lacks consistency violates the principle of parsimony is not falsifiable is not empirically testable and is not correctable dynamic tentative or progressive in light of its apparent failure to adhere to scientific standards in september two zero zero five three eight nobel laureates issued a statement saying intelligent design is fundamentally unscientific it cannot be tested as scientific theory because its central conclusion is based on belief in the intervention of a supernatural agent and in october two zero zero five a coalition representing more than seven zero zero zero zero australian scientists and science teachers issued a statement saying intelligent design is not science and called on all schools not to teach intelligent design id as science because it fails to qualify on every count as a scientific theory intelligent design critics also say that the intelligent design doctrine does not meet the criteria for scientific evidence used by most courts the daubert standard the daubert standard governs which evidence can be considered scientific in united states federal courts and most state courts the four daubert criteria are the theoretical underpinnings of the methods must yield testable predictions by means of which the theory could be falsified the methods should preferably be published in a peer reviewed journal there should be a known rate of error that can be used in evaluating the results the methods should be generally accepted within the relevant scientific community in deciding kitzmiller v dover area school district on december two zero two zero zero five judge john e jones iii ruled that we have addressed the seminal question of whether id is science we have concluded that it is not and moreover that id cannot uncouple itself from its creationist and thus religious antecedents peer review the failure to follow the procedures of scientific discourse and the failure to submit work to the scientific community which withstands scrutiny have weighed very heavily against intelligent design being considered valid science to date the intelligent design movement has yet to have an article published in a peer reviewed scientific journal intelligent design by appealing to a supernatural agent conflicts with the naturalistic orientation of science dembski behe and other intelligent design proponents claim bias by the scientific community is to blame for the failure of their research to be published intelligent design proponents believe that the merit of their writings is rejected for not conforming to purely naturalistic non supernatural mechanisms rather than on grounds of their research not being up to journal standards this claim is described as a conspiracy theory by some scientists the issue that the scientific method is based on methodological naturalism and so does not accept supernatural explanations became a sticking point for intelligent design proponents in the one nine nine zero s and is addressed in the wedge strategy as an aspect of science that must be challenged before intelligent design could be accepted by the broader scientific community the debate over whether intelligent design produces new research as any scientific field must and has legitimately attempted to publish this research is extremely heated both critics and advocates point to numerous examples to make their case for instance the templeton foundation a former funder of the discovery institute and a major supporter of projects seeking to reconcile science and religion says that they asked intelligent design proponents to submit proposals for actual research but none were ever submitted charles l harper jr foundation vice president said that from the point of view of rigor and intellectual seriousness the intelligent design people don t come out very well in our world of scientific review at the kitzmiller trial the judge found that intelligent design features no scientific research or testing the only article published in a peer reviewed scientific journal that made a case for intelligent design was quickly withdrawn by the publisher for having circumvented the journal s peer review standards written by the discovery institute s center for science perhaps the best reason to be skeptical of his ideas is that intelligent design has yet to establish itself as a thriving scientific research program in a two zero zero one interview dembski said that he stopped submitting to peer reviewed journals because of their slow time to print and that he makes more money from publishing books in sworn testimony at the kitzmiller trial behe stated that there are no peer reviewed articles by anyone advocating for intelligent design supported by pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed rigorous accounts of how intelligent design of any biological system occurred further as summarized by the judge behe conceded that there are no peer reviewed articles supporting his claims of intelligent design or irreducible complexity despite this the discovery institute continues to claim that a number of intelligent design articles have been published in peer reviewed journals including in their list the two articles mentioned above critics largely members of the scientific community reject this claim pointing out that no established scientific journal has yet published an intelligent design article and that intelligent design proponents have set up their own journals with peer review that consists entirely of intelligent design supporters which lack rigor intelligence as an observable quality the phrase intelligent design makes use of an assumption of the quality of an observable intelligence a concept that has no scientific consensus definition william dembski for example has written that intelligence leaves behind a characteristic signature such characteristics of intelligent agency are assumed to be observable without intelligent design specifying what the criteria for the measurement of intelligence should be dembski instead asserts that in special sciences ranging from forensics to archaeology to seti the search for extraterrestrial intelligence appeal to a designing intelligence is indispensable how this appeal is made and what this implies as to the definition of intelligence are topics left largely unaddressed seth shostak a researcher with the seti institute refutes dembski s claim saying that intelligent design advocates base their inference on complexity the argument being that some biological systems are too complex to have been made by natural processes while seti researchers are looking primarily for artificiality critics say that the design detection methods proposed by proponents are radically different from conventional design detection undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science intelligent design proponents they say are proposing both searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer s abilities parameters or intentions which scientists do know when searching for the results of human intelligence as well as denying the very distinction between natural artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature as a means of criticism certain skeptics have pointed to a challenge of intelligent design derived from the study of artificial intelligence the criticism is a counter to intelligent design claims about what makes a design intelligent namely that no preprogrammed device can be truly intelligent that intelligence is irreducible to natural processes in particular while there is an implicit assumption that supposed intelligence or creativity of a computer program was determined by the capabilities given to it by the computer programmer artificial intelligence need not be bound to an inflexible system of rules rather if a computer program can access randomness as a function this effectively allows for a flexible creative and adaptive intelligence evolutionary algorithms a subfield of machine learning itself a subfield of artificial intelligence have been used to mathematically demonstrate that randomness and selection can be used to evolve complex highly adapted structures that are not explicitly designed by a programmer evolutionary algorithms use the darwinian metaphor of random mutation selection and the survival of the fittest to solve diverse mathematical and scientific problems that are usually not solvable using conventional methods furthermore forays into such areas as quantum computing seem to indicate that real probabilistic functions may be available in the future intelligence derived from randomness is essentially indistinguishable from the innate intelligence associated with biological organisms and poses a challenge to the intelligent design conception of whence intelligence itself is derived namely from a designer cognitive science continues to investigate the nature of intelligence to that end but the intelligent design community for the most part seems to be content to rely on the assumption that intelligence is readily apparent as a fundamental and basic property of complex systems arguments from ignorance eugenie scott along with glenn branch and other critics has argued that many points raised by intelligent design proponents are arguments from ignorance in the argument from ignorance one claims that the lack of evidence for one view is evidence for another view scott and branch say that intelligent design is an argument from ignorance because it relies upon a lack of knowledge for its conclusion lacking a natural explanation we assume intelligent cause they contend most scientists would reply that unexplained is not unexplainable and that we don t know yet is a more appropriate response than invoking a cause outside of science particularly michael behe s demands for ever more detailed explanations of the historical evolution of molecular systems seem to assume a dichotomy where either evolution or design is the proper explanation and any perceived failure of evolution becomes a victory for design in scientific terms absence of evidence is not evidence of absence for naturalistic explanations of observed traits of living organisms scott and branch also contend that the supposedly novel contributions proposed by intelligent design proponents have not served as the basis for any productive scientific research intelligent design has also been characterized as a god of the gaps argument which has the following form there is a gap in scientific knowledge the gap is filled with acts of god or intelligent designer and therefore proves the existence of god or intelligent designer a god of the gaps argument is the theological version of an argument from ignorance the key feature of this type of argument is that it merely answers outstanding questions with explanations often supernatural that are unverifiable and ultimately themselves subject to unanswerable questions improbable versus impossible events in innumeracy mathematical illiteracy and its consequences john allen paulos suggests that the apparent improbability of a given scenario cannot necessarily be taken as an indication that this scenario is therefore more unlikely than any other potential one rarity by itself shouldn t necessarily be evidence of anything when one is dealt a bridge hand of thirteen cards the probability of being dealt that particular hand is less than one in six zero zero billion still it would be absurd for someone to be dealt a hand examine it carefully calculate that the probability of getting it is less than one in six zero zero billion and then conclude that he must not have been dealt that very hand because it is so very improbable this argument can be seen as a rebuttal to those advocates of intelligent design who claim that only a sentient creator could have arranged the universe in such a way as to be conducive to life see for example specified complexity arguments or fine tuning arguments in this context the probability of life evolving rather than having been created may appear unlikely at first sight but the evidence that this is the case could be argued to be so widespread deep and heavily scrutinized that it would be illogical to conclude that any other and arguably less scientifically compelling hypothesis should take its place as

technologies could not have built the pyramids so goblins must have done it stephen c meyer two zero zero five the scientific status of intelligent design the methodological equivalence of naturalistic and non naturalistic origins theories intelligent design is generally only internally consistent and logical within the framework in which it operates criticisms are that this framework has at its foundation an unsupported unjustified assumption that complexity and improbability must entail design but the identity and characteristics of the designer is not identified or quantified nor need they be the framework of intelligent design because it rests on a unquantifiable and unverifiable assertion has no defined boundaries except that complexity and improbability require design and the designer need not be constrained by the laws of physics intelligent design fails to pass occam s razor adding entities an intelligent agent a designer to the equation is not strictly necessary to explain events the designer is not falsifiable since its existence is typically asserted without sufficient conditions to allow a falsifying observation the designer being beyond the realm of the observable claims about its existence can neither be supported nor undermined by observation hence making intelligent design and the argument from design analytic a posteriori arguments that intelligent design is not empirically testable stems from the fact that intelligent design violates a basic premise of science naturalism intelligent design professes to offer an answer that does not need to be defined or explained the intelligent agent designer by asserting a conclusion that need not be accounted for the designer no further explanation is necessary to sustain it and objections raised to those who accept it make little headway thus intelligent design is not a provisional assessment of data which can change when new information is discovered once it is claimed that a conclusion that need not be accounted for has been established there is simply no possibility of future correction the idea of the progressive growth of scientific ideas is required to explain previous data and any previously unexplainable data the elie wiesel foundation for humanity nobel laureats initiative intelligent design cannot be tested as a scientific theory because its central

pseudoscience imperialism is a policy of extending control or authority over foreign entities as a means of acquisition and or maintenance of empires either through direct territorial conquest or through indirect methods of exerting control on the politics and or economy of other countries the term is often used to describe the policy of a country in maintaining colonies and dominance over distant lands regardless of whether the country calls itself an empire insofar as imperialism might be used to refer to an intellectual position it would imply the belief that the acquisition and maintenance of empires is a positive good probably combined with an assumption of cultural or other such superiority inherent to imperial power see the white man s burden imperialism draws heavy criticism on the grounds that historically it has been frequently employed for economic exploitation in which the imperialist power makes use of other countries as sources of raw materials and cheap labor shaping their economies to suit its own interests and keeping their people in poverty when imperialism is accompanied by overt military conquest it is also seen as a violation of freedom and human rights in recent years there has also been a trend to criticize imperialism not at an economic or political level but at a simply cultural level particularly the widespread global influence of american culture see cultural imperialism some dispute this extension however on the grounds that it is highly subjective to differentiate between mutual interaction and undue influence and also applied selectively hamburgers being imperialist and black tea not the debate continues etymology the latin root is imperium command or supreme power the original meaning of imperialist was an adherent of an emperor its current meaning dates from the late one nine th century in relation to the actions of the british empire it subsequently grew to apply to any historical or contemporary instance of a greater power acting or perceived to be acting at the expense of a lesser power imperialism is therefore not only used to describe bona fide empire building policies such as those of the romans the spanish or the british but it is also used controversially and or disparagingly for example by both sides in communist and anti communist propaganda or to describe actions of the united states since its acquisition of overseas territory during the spanish american war to its present day position as the world s only superpower modern imperialism political caricature illustrating u s and u k as world leaders there is a contemporary debate surrounding the united states and whether the power it exerts upon much of the world and its policy amounts to imperialism hence sometimes the u s is referred to as the american empire this is because with the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war the united states is now the dominant power in the world furthermore the u s has many times over the past century used both military intervention and economic or political influence to shape the countries within the western hemisphere opinions vary greatly within the u s there are those who regard the active use of military force abroad as a part of the nation s responsibility or national interest and there are others who argue for non interventionism and many shades of opinion in between the term american empire is naturally controversial since empire is largely limited to descriptions of history rather than contemporary events and likewise the historical examples of empire tend to be more familiar and evocative of the concept as such modern examples of coercion and militarism may be viewed differently the united states has also only had very few years of status as sole superpower without the soviet union as its dominant political military and ideological foe the cold war battle for geopolitical supremacy tends to be cast in terms of freedom versus repression thereby diminishing the imperial aspects of both powers further as imperialism tends to have negative connotations of tyranny and repression such a claimed empire s subjects may be naturally disinclined to use it in any reference to themselves in the early two one st century the u s has turned military political and economic resources towards oil rich countries in central asia and the middle east beginning with the end of world war ii the u s largely took over from the uk certain roles by which it exerted influence in the middle east through united states instigated and assisted assassinations and coups several middle eastern nations have felt the strong influence of western societies egypt iran iraq saudi arabia syria lebanon and israel have been directly or otherwise substantially influenced by u s policy this does not include prior or continuing british empire holdings of the time notably in india and pakistan as there are few other countries with such a capability it has been said by some that u s military actions are partly or mostly acts of militarist imperialism others simply believe that such allegations are used as groundless criticism against the u s whenever it takes a military action two uncontroversial facts are that the u s currently has a much larger and more sophisticated military than any other country operating over one zero zero bases in every part of the world the u s has also used its military to control its interests it is debatable whether these things alone constitute imperialism or whether such imperialism adequately resembles past incarnations roman british german or otherwise marxist theory of imperialism karl marx never published a theory of imperialism although he referred to colonialism in das kapital as an aspect of the prehistory of the capitalist mode of production in various articles he also analysed british colonial rule in ireland and india marxists use the term imperialism as lenin defined it the highest stage of capitalism specifically the era in which monopoly finance capital becomes dominant forcing nations and corporations to compete amongst themselves increasingly for control over resources and markets all over the world such control may take the form of geopolitical machinations military adventures or financial maneuvers this usage of the term imperialism is in some ways inaccurate since imperialism is historically implicated in the very origins of capitalism although historians differ in their assessment of its economic importance the essential feature of the marxist theories of imperialism or related theories such as dependency theory is their focus on the economic relation between countries rather than the formal political relationship imperialism thus consists not necessarily in the direct control of one country by another but in the economic exploitation of one region by another or of a group by another this marxist usage contrasts with many people s understanding of the connotation of the word imperialism which they think of as relating to the era when countries directly controlled vast empires rather than the economic domination that some parts of the world have over others today this popular view is a conflation of imperialism with colonialism the establishment of overseas colonies as noted above the marxist theory of imperialism is not founded on the works of karl marx but on those of vladimir lenin nevertheless the theory is accepted today by the majority of marxists even those who are not leninists it states that imperialism allows the capitalists from developed rich countries to extract a superprofit from the working class of undeveloped poor countries the majority of this superprofit is kept by the capitalists themselves but some of it is shared with the working class of the developed countries in the form of higher standards of living cheaper consumer goods etc in order to placate that working class and avoid revolution at home the soviet union which claimed to follow leninism proclaimed itself the foremost enemy of imperialism and supported many independence movements throughout the third world however at the same time it asserted its dominance over the countries of eastern europe this has led many to accuse the soviet union of hypocrisy and it is often used as an argument for the idea that the soviet union did not in fact follow leninist principles new developments in the marxist study of imperialism stem from the ground breaking study the age of imperialism written by harry magdoff in one nine six nine globalization is generally viewed as the latest incarnation of imperialism among marxists name dualism one thing to note in some allegedly imperialistic countries is the melting between the name and in many times the sense of national identity of the titular nation and the other territories controlled by this nation including the titular nation itself some examples are ottoman empire turkey british empire england german empire prussia soviet union russia yugoslavia serbia quotes the term imperialism is no more precise and its overuse and recent abuse is making it nearly meaningless as an analytical concept imperialism is more often the name of the emotion that reacts to a series of events than a definition of the events themselves where colonization finds

marxist theory history of colonialism ipv four is version four of the internet protocol ip and it is the first version of the internet protocol to be widely deployed ipv four is the dominant network layer protocol on the internet and when ignoring its successor ipv six it is the only protocol used on the internet it is described in ietf rfc seven nine one september one nine eight one which obsoleted rfc seven six zero january one nine eight zero ipv four is a data oriented protocol to be used on a packet switched internetwork e g ethernet it is a best effort protocol in that it doesn t guarantee delivery it doesn t make any guarantees on the correctness of the data it may result in duplicated packets and or packets out of order all of these things are addressed by an upper layer protocol e g tcp udp addressing ipv four uses three two bit four byte addresses which limits the address space to four two nine four nine six seven two nine five possible unique addresses however many are reserved for special purposes such as private networks one eight million addresses or multicast addresses one million addresses this reduces the number of addresses that can be allocated as public internet addresses and as the number of addresses available is consumed an ipv four address shortage appears to be inevitable in the long run this limitation has helped stimulate the push towards ipv six which is currently in the early stages of deployment and is currently the only contender to replace ipv four address representations when writing ipv four addresses in strings the most common notation is the dot decimal notation there are other notations based on the values of the octets of the ip address for example the ipv four address for www wikipedia org is two zero seven one four two one three one two three five in the dot decimal notation which comprises four octets in decimal separated by periods this is the base format used in the conversion in the following table all most of these formats should work in all browsers additionally in dotted format each octet can be of the different bases for example two zero seven zero x eight e zero two zero three two three five is a valid though unconventional equivalent to the above addresses a final form is not really a notation since it is rarely written in an ascii string notation that form is a binary form of the hexadecimal notation in binary this difference is merely the representational difference between the string zero xcf eight e eight three eb and the three two bit integer value zero xcf eight e eight three eb this form is used in both the source and destination fields allocation originally the ip address was divided into two parts network number first octet rest last three octets this created an upper limit of two five six networks and led to the creation of classful networks under classful networking five classes were created a b c d information from these databases plays a central role in numerous tools which attempt to locate ip addresses geographically private networks of the four billion addresses allowed in ipv four three ranges of address are reserved for private networking use only these ranges are not routable outside of private network and private machines cannot directly communicate with public networks they can however do so through network address translation the following are the three ranges reserved for private networks localhost in addition to private networking the ip range one two seven zero zero zero one two seven two five five two five five two five five or one two seven zero zero zero eight in cidr notation is reserved for localhost communication any address within this range should never appear on an actual network and any packet sent to this address should loopback as an incoming packet to the same machine resolving the internet is most publicly known not by ip addresses but by names e g www wikipedia org www whitehouse gov the routing of ip packets across the internet is oblivious to such names this requires translating or resolving names to ip address the domain name system dns provides such a system to convert names to ip address es and ip addresses to names much like cidr addressing the dns naming is also hierarchial and allows for subdelegation of name spaces to other dns servers exhaustion a concern that has spanned decades to the one nine eight zero s is the exhaustion of available ip addresses this was the driving factor in classful networks and then later in the creation of cidr addressing today there are several driving forces to the next address allocation solution mobile devices laptop computers pdas mobile phones always on devices adsls cable modems rapidly growing number of internet users the most visible solution is to migrate to ipv six since the address size jumps dramatically from three two bit to one two eight bit which would allow about one eight quintillion people their own set of one eight quintillion addresses three four e one eight total addresses however migration has proved to be a challenge in itself and total internet adoption of ipv six is unlikely to occur for many years some things that can be done to mitigate the ipv four address exhaustion are not mutually exclusive network address translation use of private networks dynamic host configuration protocol virtual hosting tighter control by regional internet registries on the allocation of addresses to local internet registries network renumbering to reclaim large blocks of address space allocated in the early days of the internet as of two zero zero four predictions for the exhaustion of the ipv four address space range from two zero one six for unallocated pool exhaustion to two zero two three for complete exhaustion of the address space historically though forward predictions for the date of address exhaustion have been unreliable predictions from the late one nine eight zero s have not been borne out in practice network address translation one method to increase both address utilization and security is to use network address translation nat by assigning one ip to a public machine as an internet gateway and using a private network for an organization s computers allows for considerable address savings this also increases security by making all of the computers on a private network not directly accessible to the public network virtual private networks since private address ranges are deliberately ignored by all public routers it is not normally possible to connect two private networks e g two branch offices via the public internet virtual private networks vpns solve this problem vpns work by inserting an ip packet encapsulated packet directly into the data field of another ip packet encapsulating packet and using a publicly routable address in the encapsulating packet once the vpn packet is routed across the public network and reaches the endpoint the encapsulated packet is extracted and then transmitted on the private network just as if the two private networks were directly connected optionally the encapsulated packet can be encrypted to secure the data while over the public network see vpn article for more details address resolution protocol since ip is an upper layer protocol to the data link layer there arises a problem of when a computer with ip address a wants to communicate with ip address b in order to send a packet from a to b then a needs to know the hardware address of b this discover is done through address resolution protocol arp reverse address resolution protocol dhcp unlike the situation outlined for arp the case arises when a computer knows its data link layer address but not its ip address this is a common scenario in private networks and digital subscriber line dsl connections when the ip address of the machines are irrelevant this is usually the case for work stations but not servers rarp is an obsoleted method for answering this question this is my hardware address what is my ip address rarp was replaced by bootp which in turn was replaced by dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp in addition to sending the ip address dhcp can also send the ntp server dns servers and more packet structure an ip packet consists of two sections header data the header consists of one three fields and of which only one two are required the one three th field is optional red background in table and aptly named options header version the first header field in an ip packet is the four bit version field for ipv four this has a value of four hence the name ipv four internet header length ihl the second field is a four bit internet header length ihl telling the number of three two bit words in the header since an ipv four header may contain a variable number of options this field specifies the size of the header which coincides with the offset to the data the minimum header size is two zero bytes so the minimum value for this field is five five four two zero bytes being a four bit field the maximum length is one five words or six zero bytes type of service tos in rfc seven nine one the following eight bits were allocated to a type of service tos field bits zero two precedence bit three zero normal delay one low delay bit four zero normal throughput one high throughput bit five zero normal reliability one high reliability bits six seven reserved for future use this field is now used for diffserv and ecn the original intention was for a sending host to specify a preference for how the datagram would be handled as it made its way through an internetwork for instance one host could set its ipv four datagrams tos field value to prefer low delay while another might prefer high reliability in practice the tos field has not been widely implemented however a great deal of experimental research and deployment work has focused on how to make use of these eight bits these bits have been redefined most recently through diffserv working group in the ietf and the explicit congestion notification codepoints see rfc three one six eight new technologies are emerging that require real time data streaming and therefore will make use of the tos field an example is voice over ip voip that is used for interactive data voice exchange total length this field defines the entire datagram size including header and data in bytes the minimum length datagram is two zero bytes two zero bytes header zero bytes data and the maximum is six five five three five the maximum value of a one six bit word the minimum size datagram which any host is required to be able to handle is five seven six bytes but most modern hosts handle much larger packets sometimes subnetworks impose further restrictions on the size in which case datagrams must be fragmented fragmentation is handled in either the host or packet switch in ipv four see fragmentation and reassembly identification this field is an identification field and is primarily used for uniquely identifying fragments of an original ip datagram some experimental work has suggested using the id field for other purposes such as for adding packet tracing information to datagrams in order to help trace back datagrams with spoofed source addresses flags a three bit field follows and is used to control or identify fragments they are in order from high order to low order reserved must be zero don t fragment df more fragments mf if the df flag is set and fragmentation is required to route the packet then the packet will be dropped this can be used when sending packets to a host that does not have sufficient resources to handle fragmentation when a packet is fragmented all fragments have the mf flag set except the last fragment which does not have the mf flag set the mf flag is also not set on packets which are not fragmented clearly an unfragment packet can be considered the last fragment fragment offset the fragment offset field is one three bits long and allows a receiver to determine the place of a particular fragment in the original ip datagram measured in units of eight byte blocks this method allows for a maximum packet length of six five five two eight two one three one eight which exceeds the maximum ip packet length of six five five three five time to live ttl an eight bit time to live ttl field helps prevent datagrams from persisting e g going in circles on an internetwork historically the ttl field limited a datagram s lifetime in seconds but has come to be a hop count field each packet switch or router that a datagram crosses decrements the ttl field by one when the ttl field hits zero the packet is no longer forwarded by a packet switch and is discarded typically an icmp message specifically the time exceeded is sent back to the sender that it has been discarded the reception of these icmp messages is at the heart of how traceroute works protocol this field defines the protocol used in the data portion of the ip datagram the internet assigned numbers authority maintains a list of protocol numbers and were originally defined in rfc seven nine zero common protocols and their decimal values are shown below see data header checksum the one six bit checksum field is used for error checking of the header at each hop the checksum of the header must be compared to the value of this field if a header checksum is found to be mismatched then the packet is discarded note that errors in the data field are up to the encapsulated protocol to handle indeed both udp and tcp have internet checksum fields since the ttl field is decremented on each hop and fragmentation is possible at each hop then at each hop the checksum will have to be recomputed the method used to compute the checksum is defined within rfc seven nine one the checksum field is the one six bit one s complement of the one s complement sum of all one six bit words in the header for purposes of computing the checksum the value of the checksum field is zero in other words all one six bit words are summed together using one s complement with the checksum field set to zero the sum is then one s complemented this final value is then inserted as the checksum field source address an ip address is a group of four eight bit octets for a total of three two bits the value for this field is determined by taking the binary value of each octet and concatenating them together to make a single three two bit value for example the address one zero nine eight seven zero zero zero zero one zero one zero zero zero zero zero one zero zero one zero zero zero zero one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one one one in binary would be zero zero zero zero one zero one zero zero zero zero zero one zero zero one zero zero zero zero one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one one one this address is the address of the sender of the packet note that this address may not be the true sender of the packet due to network address translation instead the source address will be translated by the nating machine to its own address thus reply packets sent by the receiver are routed to the nating machine which translates the destination address to the original sender s address destination address identical to the source address field but indicates the receiver of the packet options additional header fields called options may follow the destination address field but these are not often used note that the value in the ihl field must include enough extra three two bit words to hold all the options plus any padding needed to ensure that the header contains an integral number of three two bit words the list of options may be terminated with an eol end of options list option this is only necessary if the end of the options would not otherwise coincide with the end of the header the use of the lssr and ssrr options loose and strict source and record route is discouraged because they create security concerns packets with them are therefore usually blocked by routers data the last field is not apart of the header and consequently not included in the checksum field the contents of the data field are specified in the protocol header field and can be any one of the transport layer protocols some of the most commonly used protocols are listed below including their value used in the protocol field internet control message protocol icmp one internet group management protocol igmp two open shortest path first ospf eight nine real time transport protocol rtp stream control transmission protocol sctp one three two transmission control protocol tcp six user datagram protocol udp one seven see list of ipv four protocol numbers for a complete list fragmentation and reassembly to make ipv four more tolerant of different networks the concept of fragmentation was added so that if necessary a device could break up the data into smaller pieces this is necessary when the maximum transmission unit mtu is smaller than the packet size for example the maximum size of an ip packet is six five five three five bytes while the typical mtu for ethernet is one five zero zero bytes since the ip header consumes two zero bytes without options of the one five zero zero bytes that leaves one four eight zero bytes of ip data per ethernet frame this leads to an mtu for ip of one four eight zero bytes therefore a six five five three five byte data payload would require four five packets six five five three five one four eight zero four four two eight fragmentation was chosen to occur at the ip layer is that ip is the first layer that connects hosts instead of machines if fragmentation were performed on higher layers tcp udp etc then this would make fragmentation reassembly be redundantly implemented once per protocol if fragmentation were performed on a lower layer ethernet atm etc then this would require fragmentation reassembly be performed on each hope could be quite costly and redundantly implemented once per link layer protocol so doing fragmentation at the ip layer is the most efficient layer for this to be done fragmentation when a device receives an ip packet it examines the destination address and determines the outgoing interface to use this interface an associated mtu that dictates the maximum data size for its payload if the mtu is smaller than the data size then the device must fragment the data the device then segments the data into segments where each segment is less than or equal to the mtu less the ip header size two zero bytes minimum six zero bytes maximum each segment is that put into it s own ip packet with the following changes the total length field will be adjusted to the segment size the more fragments mf flag is set for all segments except the last one the fragment offset field is set accordingly based on the offset of the segment in the original data payload for example for an ip header of length two zero bytes and an ethernet mtu of one five zero zero bytes the fragment offsets would be zero one four eight zero two nine six zero four four four zero five nine two zero etc by some chance if a packet changes link layer protocols or the mtu reduces then these fragments would be fragmented again for example if a four five zero zero byte data payload is inserted into an ip packet with no options thus total length is five zero two zero bytes and is transmitted over a link with an mtu of two five zero zero bytes then it will be broken up into two fragments now let s say the mtu drops to one five zero zero bytes each fragment will individually be split up into two more fragments each indeed the amount of data has been preserved one four eight zero one zero zero zero one four eight zero five four zero four five zero zero and the last fragment offset plus data three nine six zero five four zero four five zero zero is also the total length note that fragments three more fragments flag set fragment offset field is non zero then the receiver knows it is the packet is a fragment the receiver then stores the data with the identification field fragment offset and the more fragments flag when the receiver recives a fragment with the more fragments flag not set then it knows the length of the original data payload since the fragment offset plus the data length is equivalent to the original data payload size using the example above when the receiver receives fragment four the fragment offset three nine six zero and the data length five four zero added together yield four five zero zero the original data length once it has all the fragments then it can reassemble the data in proper order by using the fragment offsets and pass it up the stack for further processing see also classful network classless inter domain routing

packet switched internetwork it follows ipv four as the second version of the internet protocol to be formally adopted for general use ipv six is intended to provide more addresses for networked devices allowing for example each cell phone and mobile electronic device to have its own address ipv four supports four three one zero nine four three billion addresses which is inadequate to give one to every living person ipv six supports three four one zero three eight addresses or five one zero two eight for each of the roughly six five billion people alive today invented by steve deering and craig mudge at xerox parc ipv six was adopted by the internet engineering task force in one nine nine four when it was called ip next generation ipng incidentally ipv five was not a successor to ipv four but an experimental flow oriented streaming protocol intended to support video and audio as of december two zero zero five ipv six accounts for a tiny percentage of the live addresses in the publicly accessible internet which is still dominated by ipv four the adoption of ipv six has been slowed by the introduction of network address translation nat which partially alleviates address exhaustion the u s government has specified that all federal agencies must deploy ipv six by two zero zero eight it is expected that ipv four will be supported alongside ipv six for the foreseeable future features of ipv six to a great extent ipv six is a conservative extension of ip most transport and application layer protocols need little or no change to work over ipv six exceptions are applications protocols that embed network layer addresses such as ftp or ntpv three larger address space the main feature of ipv six is the larger address space addresses in ipv six are one two eight bits long the larger address space allows to avoid the potential exhaustion of the ipv four address space without the need for nat and other devices that break the end to end nature of internet traffic one two eight bits might seem overkill to achieve that goal however since ipv six addresses are plentiful it is reasonable to allocate addresses in large blocks which makes administration easier and avoids fragmentation of the address space which in turn leads to smaller routing tables the current allocation policies allocate six four bits of address space to an end user and nine six bits or more to an organization another advantage of the larger address space is that it makes scanning certain ip blocks for vulnerabilities significantly more difficult than in ipv four which makes ipv six more tolerant against malicious traffic stateless autoconfiguration of hosts ipv six hosts can configure automatically when connected to a routed ipv six network when first connected to a network a host sends a link local multicast broadcast request for its configuration parameters if configured suitably routers respond to such a request with a router advertisement packet if ipv six autoconfiguration is not suitable a host can use stateful autoconfiguration dhcpv six or be configured manually stateless autoconfiguration is only suitable for hosts routers must be configured manually or by other means multicast multicast both on the local link and across routers is part of the base protocol suite in ipv six this is in opposition to ipv four where multicast is optional and only rarely deployed across routers ipv six does not have a link local broadcast facility the same effect can be achieved by multicasting to the all hosts group with a hop count of one jumbograms in ipv four packets are limited to six four kb of payload when used over suitable link layers ipv six has support for packets over this limit affectionately known as jumbograms use of jumbograms might improve performance over high throughput networks for example on myrinet the mtu is effectively unlimited and ipv six over myrinet could use jumbograms to send very large payloads faster routing by using a simpler and more systematic header structure ipv six was supposed to improve the performance of routing recent advances in router technology however may have made this improvement obsolete network layer security ipsec the protocol for ip network layer encryption and authentication is an integral part of the base protocol suite in ipv six it is however not yet deployed widely except for securing bgp traffic between ipv six routers addressing one two eight bit length the primary change from ipv four to ipv six is the length of network addresses ipv six addresses are one two eight bits long as defined by rfc two three seven three and rfc two three seven four ipv six addresses are typically composed of two logical parts a six four bit network prefix and a six four bit host part which is either automatically generated from the interface s mac address or assigned sequentially notation ipv six addresses are normally written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits for example two zero zero one zero db eight eight five a three zero eight d three one three one nine eight a two e zero three seven zero seven three three four is a valid ipv six address if a four digit group is zero zero zero zero the zeros may be omitted for example two zero zero one zero db eight eight five a three zero zero zero zero one three one nine eight a two e zero three seven zero seven three four four can be shortened as two zero zero one zero db eight eight five a three one three one nine eight a two e zero three seven zero seven three four four following this rule any group of consecutive zero zero zero zero groups may be reduced to two colons as long as there is only one double colon used in an address thus the lines below are all valid and equivalent two zero zero one zero db eight zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one four two eight five seven ab two zero zero one zero db eight zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one four two eight five seven ab two zero zero one zero db eight zero zero zero zero one four two eight five seven ab two zero zero one zero db eight zero zero one four two eight five seven ab two zero zero one zero db eight one four two eight five seven ab having more than one double colon abbreviation in an address is invalid as it would make the notation ambiguous leading zeros in a group can be omitted thus two zero zero one zero db eight zero two de zero e one three may be shortened to two zero zero one db eight two de e one three a sequence of four bytes at the end of an ipv six address can also be written in decimal using dots as separators this notation is often used with compatibility addresses see below thus ffff one two three four is the same address as ffff one zero two three zero four additional information can be found at rfc three five one three ip version six addressing architecture network notation ipv six networks are written using cidr notation an ipv six network or subnet is a contiguous group of ipv six addresses the size of which must be a power of two the initial bits of addresses which are identical for all hosts in the network are called the network s prefix a network is denoted by the first address in the network and the size in bits of the prefix separated with a slash for example two zero zero one one two three four five six seven eight nine abc six four stands for the network with addresses two zero zero one one two three four five six seven eight nine abc through two zero zero one one two three four five six seven eight nine abc ffff ffff ffff ffff because a single host can be seen as a network with a one two eight bit prefix you will sometimes see host addresses written followed with one two eight special addresses there are a number of addresses with special meaning in ipv six one two eight the address with all zeroes is used to specify any address and is only to be used in software one one two eight the loopback address is a localhost address if an application in an host sends packets to this address the ipv six stack will loop these packets back to the same host corresponding to one two seven zero zero one in ipv four nine six the zero prefix was used for ipv four compatible addresses see transition mechanisms below ffff zero zero nine six this prefix is used for ipv four mapped addresses see transition mechanisms below fc zero zero seven unique local ipv six unicast addresses are only routable within a set of cooperating sites they were defined in rfc four one nine three as a replacement for site local addresses see below the addresses include a four zero bit pseudorandom number that minimizes the risk of conflicts if sites merge or packets somehow leak out fe eight zero one zero the link local prefix specifies that the address only is valid in the local physical link this is analogous to the autoconfiguration ip address one six nine two five four x x in v four fec zero one zero the site local prefix specifies that the address is only valid inside the local organisation its use has been deprecated in september two zero zero four by rfc three eight seven nine and future systems must not implement any support for this special type of address anymore ff zero zero eight the multicast prefix is used for multicast addresses there are no address ranges reserved for broadcast in ipv six applications are supposed to use multicast to the all hosts group instead ipv six packet the structure of an ipv six packet header the ipv six packet is composed of two main parts the header and the payload the header is in the first four zero octets of the packet and contains both source and destination addresses one two eight bits each as well as the version four bit ip version traffic class eight bits packet priority flow label two zero bits qos management payload length one six bits next header eight bits and hop limit eight bits time to live the payload can be up to six four k in size in standard mode or larger with a jumbo payload option fragmentation is handled only in the sending host in ipv six routers never fragment a packet and hosts are expected to use pmtu discovery in ipv six options move out of the standard header and are specified by the next header field similar in function to ipv four s protocol field a handwaving example in ipv four one would add a strict source and record routing ssrr option to the ipv four header itself in order to enforce a certain route for the packet but in ipv six one would make the next header field indicate that a routing header comes next the routing header would then specify the additional routing information for the packet and then indicate that for example the tcp header comes next this is analogous to the handling of ah and esp in ipsec for ipv four which applies to ipv six as well of course ipv six and the domain name system ipv six addresses are represented in the domain name system by aaaa records so called quad a records for forward lookups reverse lookups take place under ip six arpa previously ip six int where address space is delegated on nibble boundaries this scheme which is a straightforward adaptation of the familiar a record and in addr arpa schemes is defined in rfc three five nine six the aaaa scheme was one of two proposals at the time the ipv six architecture was being designed the other proposal would have had a six records for the forward lookup and a number of other innovations such as bit string labels and dname records it is defined in the experimental rfc two eight seven four and its references with further discussion of the pros and cons of both schemes in rfc three three six four ipv six deployment in february one nine nine nine the ipv six forum was founded by the ietf deployment wg to drive deployment worldwide creating by now over three zero ipv six country fora and ipv six task forces ipv six forum on two zero july two zero zero four icann announced that the root dns servers for the internet had been modified to support both ipv six and ipv four a global view into the ipv six routing tables which displays also which isp s are already deploying ipv six can be found by looking at the sixxs ghost router hunter pages these pages display a list of all allocated ipv six prefixes and giving colors to the ones that are actually being announced in bgp when a prefix is announced that means that the isp at least can receive ipv six packets for their prefix they might then actually also offer ipv six services maybe even to end users sites directly transition mechanisms until ipv six completely supplants ipv four which is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future a number of so called transition mechanisms are needed to enable ipv six only hosts to reach ipv four services and to allow isolated ipv six hosts and networks to reach the ipv six internet over the ipv four infrastructure dual stack since ipv six is a conservative extension of ipv four it is relatively easy to write a network stack that supports both ipv four and ipv six while sharing most of the code such an implementation is called a dual stack and a host implementing a dual stack is called a dual stack host this approach is described in rfc two eight nine three most current implementations of ipv six use a dual stack some early experimental implementations used independent ipv four and ipv six stacks there are no known implementations that implement ipv six only tunneling in order to reach the ipv six internet an isolated host or network must be able to use the existing ipv four infrastructure to carry ipv six packets this is done using a technique somewhat misleadingly known as tunnelling which consists in encapsulating ipv six packets within ipv four in effect using ipv four as a link layer for ipv six ipv six packets can be directly encapsulated within ipv four packets using a protocol number of four one they can also be encapsulated within udp packets e g in order to cross a router or nat device that block protocol four one traffic they can of course also use generic encapsulation schemes such as ayiya or gre automatic tunneling automatic tunneling refers to a technique where the tunnel endpoints are automatically determined by the routing infrastructure the recommended technique for automatic tunneling is six to four tunneling which uses protocol four one encapsulation tunnel endpoints are determined by using a well known ipv four anycast address on the remote side and embedding ipv four address information within ipv six addresses on the local side six to four is widely deployed today teredo is an automatic tunneling technique that uses udp encapsulation and is claimed to be able to cross multiple nat boxes teredo is not widely deployed

architecture for other meanings of inca see inca disambiguation a view of machu picchu the lost city of the incas now an archaeological site the inca empire tawantin suyu in quechua modern orthography or tahuantinsuyo in hispanicized quechua orthography the four united regions was an empire centered in what is now peru from ad one four three eight to ad one five three three over that period the inca used conquest and peaceful assimilation to incorporate in their empire a large portion of western south america centred on the andean mountain ranges the inca empire proved short lived by ad one five three three atahualpa the last inca emperor called a sapa inca was killed on the orders of the conquistador francisco pizarro marking the beginning of spanish rule tawantinsuyu the indigenous name of the empire derives from the quechua tawa four to which the suffix ntin together or united is added followed by suyu region or province which roughly renders as the land of the four parts together the empire was divided into four suyu s whose corners according to inca mythology met at the navel of the world qosqo where their capital cusco was located now in modern day peru the official language of the empire was quechua although over seven hundred local languages were spoken the inca leadership encouraged the worship of their gods the foremost of which was inti the sun god origin stories see also inca mythology the inca had two main origin myths in one tici viracocha of colina de las ventanas in pacaritambo sent forth his four sons and four daughters to establish a village along the way sinchi roca was born to manco and ocllo and sinchi roca is the person who finally led them to the valley of cuzco where they founded their new village there manco became their leader and became known as manco capac in the other origin myth the sun god inti ordered manco capac and mama ocllo to emerge from the depths of lake titicaca and found the city of cuzco they traveled by means of underground caves until reaching cuzco where they established hurin cuzco or the first dynasty of the kingdom of cuzco the knowledge of these myths is due to oral tradition since the incas did not have writing there probably did exist a manco capac who became the leader of his tribe the archeological evidence seems to indicate that the inca were a relatively unimportant tribe until the time of sinchi roca also called cinchi roca who is the first figure in inca mythology whose existence can be supported historically emergence and expansion inca expansion one four three eight one five two seven ce the inca people began as a tribe in the cuzco area around the one two th century ce under the leadership of manco capac they formed the small city state of cuzco quechua qosqo shown in red on the map in one four three eight ce under the command of sapa inca paramount leader pachacuti whose name literally meant world shaker they began a far reaching expansion the land pachacuti conquered was about the size of the thirteen colonies of the united states in one seven seven six and consisted of nearly the entire andes mountain range pachacuti reorganized the kingdom of cuzco into an empire the tahuantinsuyu a federalist system which consisted of a central government with the inca at its head and four provincial governments with strong leaders chinchasuyu nw antisuyu ne contisuyu sw and collasuyu se pachacuti is also thought to have built machu picchu either as a family home or as a camp david like retreat pachacuti would send spies to regions he wanted in his empire who would report back on their political organization military might and wealth he would then send messages to the leaders of these lands extolling the benefits of joining his empire offering them presents of luxury goods such as high quality textiles and promising that they would be materially richer as subject rulers of the inca most accepted the rule of the inca as a fait accompli and acquiesced peacefully the ruler s children would then be brought to cuzco to be taught about inca administration systems then return to rule their native lands this allowed the inca to indoctrinate the former ruler s children into the inca nobility and with luck marry their daughters into families at various corners of the empire it was traditional for the inca s son to lead the army pachacuti s son t pac inca began conquests to the north in one four six three and continued them as inca after pachucuti s death in one four seven one his most important conquest was the kingdom of chimor the inca s only serious rival for the coast of peru t pac inca s empire stretched north into modern day ecuador and colombia t pac inca s son huayna c pac added significant territory to the south at its height tahuantinsuyu included peru and bolivia most of what is now ecuador a large portion of modern day chile and extended into corners of argentina and colombia tahuantinsuyu was a patchwork of languages cultures and peoples the components of the empire were not all uniformly loyal nor were the local cultures all fully integrated for instance the chim used money in their commerce while the inca empire as a whole had an economy based on exchange and taxation of luxury goods and labour it is said that inca tax collectors would take the head lice of the lame and old as a symbolic tribute the portions of the chachapoya that had been conquered were almost openly hostile to the inca and the inca nobles rejected an offer of refuge in their kingdom after their troubles with the spanish spanish conquest and vilcabamba main article spanish conquest of the inca empire spanish conquistadors led by francisco pizarro explored south from panama reaching inca territory by one five two six it was clear that they had reached a wealthy land with prospects of great treasure and after one more expedition one five two nine pizarro travelled to spain and received royal approval to conquer the region and be its viceroy at the time they returned to peru in one five three two a war of succession between huayna capac s sons huascar and atahualpa and unrest among newly conquered territories and perhaps more importantly smallpox which had spread from central america had considerably weakened the empire pizarro did not have a formidable force with just one eight zero men one cannon and only two seven horses he often needed to talk his way out of potential confrontations that could have easily wiped out his party their first engagement was the battle of pun near present day guayaquil ecuador pizarro then founded the city of piura in july one five three two hernando de soto was sent inland to explore the interior and returned with an invitation to meet the inca atahualpa who had defeated his brother in the civil war and was resting at cajamarca with his army of eight zero zero zero zero troops pizarro met with the inca who had brought only a small retinue and through interpreters demanded that he convert to christianity atahualpa was handed a bible and threw it on the floor which the spanish interpreted as adequate reason for war though some chroniclers suggest that atahualpa simply didn t understand the notion of a book the spanish attacked the inca s retinue see battle of cajamarca capturing atahualpa atahualpa offered the spaniards enough gold to fill the room he was imprisoned in and twice that amount of silver the incas fulfilled this ransom but pizarro refused to release the inca during atahualpa s imprisonment huascar was assassinated the spanish maintained that this was at atahualpa s orders this was one of the charges used against atahualpa when the spanish finally decided to put him to death in august one five three three the spanish installed his brother manco inca yupanqui in power for some time manco cooperated with the spanish while the spanish fought to put down resistance in the north meanwhile an associate of pizarro s diego de almagro attempted to claim cusco for himself manco tried to use this intra spanish feud to his advantage recapturing cusco one five three six but the spanish retook the city manco inca then retreated to the mountains of vilcabamba where he and his successors ruled for another three six years sometimes raiding the spanish or inciting revolts against them in one five seven two the last inca stronghold was discovered and the last ruler t pac amaru manco s son was captured and executed bringing the inca empire to an end after the spanish conquest after the fall of tahuantinsuyu the new spanish rulers brutally repressed the people and their traditions many aspects of inca culture were systematically destroyed including their sophisticated farming system the spanish used the inca mita mandatory public service system to literally work the people to death one member of each family was forced to work in the gold and silver mines the foremost of which was the titanic silver mine at potos when one family member died which would usually happen within a year or two the family would be required to send a replacement the major languages of the empire quechua and aymara were employed by the catholic church to evangelize in the andean region in some cases these languages were taught to peoples who had originally spoken other indigenous languages today quechua and aymara remain the most widespread amerindian languages the legend of the inca has served as inspiration for resistance movements in the region these include the one seven eight zero rebellion led by tupac amaru ii against the spanish as well as contemporary the guerrilla movements t pac amaru revolutionary movement mrta and sendero luminoso in peru and tupamaros in uruguay tawantinsuyu has a modern rainbow flag which is displayed throughout peru society political organization of the empire ollantaytambo constituted an administrative religious agricultural and military complex for the incas the most powerful figure in the empire was the sapa inca the unique inca when a new ruler was chosen his subjects would build his family a new royal dwelling the former royal dwelling would remain the dwelling of the former inca s family only descendants of the original inca tribe ever ascended to the level of inca most young members of the inca s family attended yachayhuasis houses of knowledge to obtain their education the tahuantinsuyu was a federalist system which consisted of a central government with the inca at its head and four provinces chinchaysuyu nw antisuyu ne qontisuyu sw and qollasuyu se the four corners of these provinces met at the center cuzco each province had a governor who oversaw local officials who in turn supervised agriculturally productive river valleys cities and mines there were separate chains of command for both the military and religious institutions which created a system of partial checks and balances on power the local officials were responsible for settling disputes and keeping track of each family s contribution to the mita mandatory public service the four provincial governors were called apos the next rank down the tukuyrikuq local leaders numbered about nine zero in total and typically managed a city and its hinterlands below them were four levels of administration every five waranqa curaca pachaka curaca and chunka kamayuq had an intermediary to the next level called respectively picqa waranqa curaca picqa pacaka curaca and picqa conka kamayoq this means that the middle managers managed either two or five people while the conka kamayoq at the worker manager level and the apos and t oqrikoq in upper management each had about two zero people reporting to them the descendants of the original inca tribe were not numerous enough to administer their empire without help to cope with the need for leadership at all levels the inca established a civil service system boys at age of one three and girls at age of first menstruation had their intelligence tested by the local inca officials if they failed their ayllu extended family group would teach them one of many trades such as farming gold working weaving or military skills if they passed the test they were sent to cuzco to attend school to become administrators there they learned to read the quipu knotted cord records and were taught inca iconography leadership skills religion and most importantly mathematics the graduates of this school constituted the nobility and were expected to marry within that nobility while some workers were held in great esteem such as royal goldsmiths and weavers they could never themselves enter the ruling classes the best they could hope for was that their children might pass the exam as adolescents to enter the civil service although workers were considered the lowest social class they were entitled to a modicum of what today we call due process and all classes were equally subject to the rule of law for example if a worker was accused of stealing and the charges were proven false the local official could be punished for not doing his job properly arts the inca were a conquering society and their expansionist assimilation of other cultures is evident in their artistic style the artistic style of the inca utilized the vocabulary of many regions and cultures but incorporated these themes into a standardized imperial style that could easily be replicated and spread throughout the empire the simple abstract geometric forms and highly stylized animal representation in ceramics wood carvings textiles and metalwork were all part of the inca culture the motifs were not as revivalist as previous empires no motifs of other societies were directly used with the exception of huari and tiwanaku arts architecture main article incan architecture architecture was by far the most important of the inca arts with pottery and textiles reflecting motifs that were at their height in architecture the stone temples constructed by the inca used a mortarless construction process first used on a large scale by the tiwanaku the inca imported the stoneworkers of the tiwanaku region to cusco when they conquered the lands south of lake titicaca the rocks used in construction were sculpted to fit together exactly by repeatedly lowering a rock onto another and carving away any sections on the lower rock where the dust was compressed the tight fit and the concavity on the lower rocks made them extraordinarily stable in the frequent earthquakes that strike the area the inca used straight walls except on important religious sites and constructed whole towns at once the inca also sculpted the natural surroundings themselves one could easily think that a rock along an inca trail is completely natural except if one sees it at the right time of year when the sun casts a stunning shadow betraying its synthetic form the inca rope bridges were also used to transport messages and materials by chasqui running messengers the inca also adopted the terraced agriculture that the previous huari civilization had popularized but they did not use the terraces solely for food production at the inca tambo or inn at ollantaytambo the terraces were planted with flowers extraordinary in this parched land the terraces of moray were left unirrigated in a desert area and seem to have been solely decorative the inca provincial thrones were often carved into natural outcroppings and there were over three six zero natural springs in the areas surrounding cusco such as the one at tambo machay at tambo machay the natural rock was sculpted and stonework was added creating alcoves and directing the water into fountains these pseudo natural carvings functioned to show both the inca s respect for nature and their command over it clothing inca tunic inca officials wore stylized tunics that indicated their status the tunic displayed here is the highest status tunic known to exist today it contains an amalgamation of motifs used in the tunics of particular officeholders for instance the black and white checkerboard pattern topped with a red triangle is believed to have been worn by soldiers of the inca army some of the motifs make reference to earlier cultures such as the stepped diamonds of the huari and the three step stairstep motif of the moche in this royal tunic no two squares are exactly the same cloth was divided into three classes awaska was used for household use having an approximate threadcount of about one two zero threads per inch finer cloth qunpi was divided into two classes the first woven by male qunpikamayuq keepers of fine cloth was collected as tribute from throughout the country and was used for trade to adorn rulers and to be given as gifts to political allies and subjects to cement loyalty the other class of qunpi ranked highest it was woven by aqlla female virgins of the sun god temple and used solely for royal and religious use these had threadcounts of six zero zero or more per inch unsurpassed anywhere in the world until the industrial revolution of the one nine th century aside from the tunic a person of importance wore a llawt u a series of cords wrapped around the head to establish his importance the inca atahualpa commissioned a llawt u woven from vampire bat hair the leader of each ayllu or extended family had its own headdress in conquered regions traditional clothing continued to be worn but the finest weavers such as those of chan chan were transferred to cusco and kept there to weave qunpi the chim had previously transferred these same weavers to chan chan from sican the wearing of jewellery was not uniform throughout the empire chim artisans for example continued to wear earrings after their integration into the empire but in many other regions only local leaders wore them ceramics and metalwork ceramics were for the most part utilitarian in nature but also incorporated the imperialist style that was prevalent in the inca textiles and metalwork in addition the inca played drums and on woodwind instruments including flutes pan pipes and trumpets made of shell and ceramics the inca made beautiful objects of gold but precious metals were in much shorter supply than in earlier peruvian cultures the inca metalworking style draws much of its inspiration from chim art and in fact the best metal workers of chan chan were transferred to cusco when the kingdom of chimor was incorporated into the empire unlike the chim the inca do not seem to have regarded metals to be as precious as fine cloth when the spanish first encountered the inca they were offered gifts of qunpi cloth education representation of an incan quipu main article inca education the inca used quipu knotted cords for accounting and census purposes most of the information on the quipus has been shown to be numeric data some numbers seem to have been used as mnemonic labels and the color spacing and structure of the quipu carried information as well since it isn t known how to interpret the coded or non numeric data some scholars still hope to find that the quipu recorded language like the aztec they also depended largely on oral transmission as a means of maintaining the preservation of their culture inca education was divided into two distinct categories vocational education for common inca and highly formalized training for the nobility religion main article inca religion other article inca mythology the incan religion was polytheistic sun god earth goddess corn god etc subjects of the empire were allowed to worship their ancestral gods as long as they accepted the supremacy of inti the sun god which was the most important god worshipped by the inca leadership consequently ayllus extended families and city states integrated into the empire were able to continue to worship their ancestral gods though with reduced status much of the contact between the upper and lower classes was religious in nature and consisted of intricate ceremonies that sometimes lasted from sunrise to sunset medicine the inca made many discoveries in medicine they performed successful skull surgery which involved cutting holes in the skull to release pressure from head wounds coca leaves were used to lessen hunger and pain as they still are in the andes the chasqui messengers chewed coca leaves for extra energy to carry on their tasks as runners delivering messages throughout the empire recent research by erasmus university and medical center workers sewbalak and van der wijk showed that contrary to popular belief the inca people were not addicted to coca another remedy was to cover boiled bark from a pepper tree and place it over a wound while still warm the inca also used guinea pigs not only for food but for a so called well working medicine burial practices the inca believed in reincarnation those who obeyed the incan moral code ama suwa ama llulla ama quella do not steal do not lie do not be lazy went to live in the sun s warmth others spent their eternal days in the cold earth the inca also believed in mummifying prominent personages the mummies would be provided with an assortment of objects which were to be taken into the pacarina upon reaching the pacarina the mummies or mallqui would be able to converse with the area s other ancient ancestors the huacas the mallquis were also used in various rituals or celebrations the deceased were generally buried in a sitting position one such example was the five zero zero year old mummy juanita the ice maiden a girl very well preserved in ice that was discovered at two zero zero zero zero feet near the summit of mt ampato in southern peru her burial included many items left as offerings to the inca gods other practices the inca practiced cranial deformation they achieved this by wrapping tight cloth straps around the heads of newborns in order to alter the shape of their still soft skulls these deformations did not result in brain damage researchers from the field museum believe that the practice was used to mark different ethnicities across the inca empire food and farming around two zero zero varieties of peruvian potatoes were all first cultivated by the incas and their predecessors it is estimated that the inca cultivated around seventy crop species the main crops were potatoes sweet potatoes maize chili peppers cotton tomatoes peanuts an edible root called oca and grains known as quinoa and amaranth the many important crops developed by the inca and preceding cultures makes south america one of the historic centers of crop diversity along with the middle east india mesoamerica ethiopia and the far east many of these crops were widely distributed by the spanish and are now important crops worldwide many varieties of peruvian maize corn were well known to the incas for centuries the inca cultivated food crops on dry pacific coastlines high on the slopes of the andes and in the lowland amazon rainforest in mountainous andean environments they made extensive use of terraced fields which not only allowed them to put to use the mineral rich mountain soil which other peoples left fallow but also took advantage of micro climates conducive to a variety of crops being cultivated throughout the year agricultural tools consisted mostly of simple digging sticks the inca also raised llamas and alpacas for their wool and meat and to use them as pack animals and captured wild vicu as for their fine hair the inca road system was key to farming success as it allowed distribution of foodstuffs over long distances the inca also constructed vast storehouses which allowed them to live through el ni o years in style while neighboring civilizations suffered inca leaders kept records of what each ayllu in the empire produced but did not tax them on their production they instead used the mita for the support of the empire the inca diet consisted primarily of fish and vegetables supplemented less frequently with the meat of cuyes guinea pigs and camelids in addition they hunted various animals for meat skins and feathers maize was used to make chicha a fermented beverage

switched internetwork data in an ip internetwork are sent in blocks referred to as packets or datagrams the terms are basically synonymous in ip in particular in ip no setup of path is needed before a host tries to send packets to a host it has previously not communicated with the internet protocol provides an unreliable datagram service also called best effort i e it makes almost no guarantees about the packet the packet may arrive damaged it may be out of order compared to other packets sent between the same hosts it may be duplicated or it may be dropped entirely if an application needs reliability it is provided by other means typically by upper level protocols transported on top of ip internetwork routers forward ip datagrams across interconnected layer two networks the lack of any delivery guarantees means that the design of packet switches is made much simpler note that if the network does drop reorder or otherwise damage a lot of packets the performance seen by the user will be poor so most network elements do try hard to not do these things hence the best effort term however an occasional error will produce no noticeable effect ip is the common element found in today s public internet the current and most popular network layer protocol in use today is ipv four this version of the protocol is assigned version four ipv six is the proposed successor to ipv four the internet is slowly running out of ipv four addresses as ipv four uses three two bits for addressing giving four billion addresses ipv six uses one two eight bits for the source and destination addresses providing a maximum of three four one zero three eight addresses though see the ipv six article for details versions zero through three were either reserved or unused version five was used for an experimental stream protocol other version numbers have been assigned usually for experimental protocols but have not been widely used ip addressing and routing perhaps the most complex aspects of ip are addressing and routing addressing refers to how end hosts become assigned ip addresses and how subnetworks of ip host addresses are divided and grouped together ip routing is performed by

impeachment of political figures for the concept of casting doubt on the testimony of a witness at trial see witness impeachment depiction of the impeachment trial of andrew johnson then president of the united states in one eight six eight impeachment is the process by which a legislative body formally levels charges against a high official of government impeachment does not necessarily mean removal from office it comprises only a formal statement of charges akin to an indictment in criminal law and thus is only the first step towards possible removal once an individual is impeached he or she must then face the possibility of conviction via legislative vote which then entails the removal of the individual from office conviction of officials involves an overturning of the normal constitutional procedures by which individuals achieve high office whether by election ratification or appointment and because it generally requires a supermajority typically only those deemed to have seriously abused their offices will suffer impeachment one tradition of impeachment has its origins in the law of england and wales where the procedure last took place in one eight zero six impeachment exists under constitutional law in many nations around the world including the united states brazil russia the philippines and the republic of ireland etymologically the word impeachment derives from latin roots expressing the idea of becoming caught or entrapped and has analogues in the modern french verb emp cher to prevent and the modern english impede mediaeval popular etymology also associated it wrongly with derivations from the latin impetere to attack impeachment of a witness means challenging his or her honesty or credibility united kingdom procedure in the united kingdom the house of commons holds the power of initiating an impeachment any member may make accusations of high treason or high crimes and misdemeanours the member must support the charges with evidence and move for impeachment if the commons carries the motion the mover receives orders to go to the bar at the house of lords and to impeach the accused in the name of the house of commons and all the commons of the united kingdom the mover must tell the lords that the house of commons will in due time exhibit particular articles against the accused and make good the same the commons then usually selects a committee to draw up the charges and create an article of impeachment for each in the case of warren hastings however the drawing up of the articles preceded the formal impeachment once the committee has delivered the articles to the lords replies go between the accused and the commons via the lords if the commons have impeached a peer the lords take custody of the accused otherwise custody goes to black rod the accused remains in custody unless the lords allow bail the lords set a date for the trial while the commons appoints managers who act as prosecutors in the trial the accused may defend by counsel the house of lords hears the case with the lord chancellor presiding or the lord high steward if the impeachment relates to a peer accused of high treason the hearing resembles an ordinary trial both sides may call witnesses and present evidence at the end of the hearing the lord chancellor puts the question on the first article to each member in order of seniority commencing with the most junior peer and ending with himself and after all have voted proceeds to deal with any remaining articles similarly upon being called a lord must rise and declare upon his honour guilty or not guilty after voting on all of the articles has taken place and if the lords find the defendant guilty the commons may move for judgment the lords may not declare the punishment until the commons have so moved the lords may then provide whatever punishment they find fit within the law a royal pardon cannot excuse the defendant from trial but a pardon may reprieve a convicted defendant history parliament has held the power of impeachment since medi val times originally the house of lords held that impeachment could only apply to members of the peerage nobles as the nobility the lords would try their own peers while commoners ought to try their peers other commoners in a jury however in one six eight one the commons declared that they had the right to impeach whomsoever they pleased and the lords have respected this resolution after the reign of edward iv impeachment fell into disuse the bill of attainder becoming the preferred form of dealing with undesirable subjects of the crown however during the reign of james i and thereafter impeachments became more popular as they did not require the assent of the crown while bills of attainder did thus allowing parliament to resist royal attempts to dominate parliament the most recent cases of impeachment dealt with warren hastings governor general of india between one seven seven three and one seven eight six impeached in one seven eight eight the lords found him not guilty in one seven nine five and henry dundas one st viscount melville first lord of the admiralty in one eight zero six acquitted the last attempted impeachment occurred in one eight four eight when david urquhart accused viscount palmerston of having signed a secret treaty with imperial russia and of receiving monies from the tsar palmerston survived the vote in the commons the lords did not hear the case impeachment in modern politics the procedure has over time become rarely used and some legal authorities such as halsbury s laws of england consider it to be probably obsolete the principles of responsible government require that the prime minister and other executive officers answer to parliament rather than to the sovereign thus the commons can remove such an officer without a long drawn out impeachment however it is argued by some that the remedy of impeachment remains as part of british constitutional law and that legislation would be required to abolish it furthermore impeachment as a means of punishment for wrongdoing as distinct from being a means of removing a minister remains a valid reason for accepting that is continues to be available at least in theory in april one nine seven seven the young liberals annual conference unanimously passed a motion to call on the liberal leader david steel to move for the impeachment of ronald king murray qc the lord advocate mr steel did not call the motion but murray now lord murray a former senator of the college of justice of scotland agrees

the impeachment trial of president bill clinton in one nine nine nine chief justice william h rehnquist presiding the house managers are seated beside the quarter circular tables on the left and the president s personal counsel on the right much in the fashion of president andrew johnson s trial in the united states impeachment can occur both at the federal and state level at the federal level both the executive branch and the judiciary may be impeached though different standards apply for the executive branch only those who have allegedly committed treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors may be impeached although treason and bribery are obvious the constitution is silent on what constitutes a high crime several commentators have suggested that congress alone may decide for itself what constitutes an impeachable offense the standard for impeachment among the judiciary is much broader article iii of the constitution states that judges remain in office during good behavior implying that congress may remove a judge for bad behavior members of congress themselves are not subject to impeachment however the house of representatives and the senate have the authority to discipline and expel their own members the procedure is in two steps the house of representatives must first pass articles of impeachment by a simple majority all fifty state legisatures as well as the district of columbia city council may also pass articles of impeachment the articles of impeachment constitute the formal allegations upon their passage the defendant has been impeached next the senate tries the accused in the case of the impeachment of a president the chief justice of the united states presides over the proceedings otherwise the vice president in his capacity of president of the senate or the president pro tempore of the senate presides this would include the impeachment of the vice president him or herself in order to convict the accused a two thirds majority of the senators present is required following conviction the senate may vote to punish the individual only by removing him from office or by barring him from holding future office or both alternatively it may impose no punishment however in the case of executive officers removal follows automatically upon conviction the defendant remains liable to criminal prosecution it is possible to impeach someone even after the accused has vacated his office in order to disqualify the person from such emoluments of office as a pension congress regards impeachment as a power to be used only in extreme cases the house has initiated impeachment proceedings only six two times since one seven eight nine most recently bill clinton and only the following one six federal officers have been impeached many mistakenly assume richard nixon was impeached but he resigned prior to the house s action in the face of the near certainty of both his impeachment by the house of representatives and his conviction by the senate associate justice samuel chase in one eight zero four president bill clinton was impeached on december one nine one nine nine eight by the house of representatives on grounds of perjury to a grand jury by a two two eight two zero six vote and obstruction of justice by a two two one two one two vote two other articles of impeachment failed a second count of perjury in the jones case by a two zero five two two nine vote and one accusing clinton of abuse of power by a one four eight two eight five vote was acquitted by the senate president andrew johnson in one eight six eight president johnson was acquitted of all charges by a single vote in the senate one cabinet officer one senator eleven other federal judges republic of ireland in the republic of ireland formal impeachment can apply only to the president article one two of the constitution of ireland provides that unless judged to be permanently incapacitated by the supreme court the president can only be removed from office by the houses of the oireachtas parliament and only for the commission of stated misbehaviour either house of the oireachtas may impeach the president but only by a resolution approved by a majority of at least two thirds of its total number of members and a house may not consider a proposal for impeachment unless requested to do so by at least thirty of its number where one house impeaches the president the remaining house either investigates the charge or commissions another body or committee to do so the investigating house can remove the president if it decides by at least a two thirds majority of its members both that she is guilty of the charge of which she stands accused and that the charge is sufficiently serious as to warrant her removal to date no impeachment of an irish president has ever taken place the president holds a largely ceremonial office the dignity of which is considered important so it is likely that a president would resign from office long before undergoing formal conviction or impeachment the republic s constitution and law also provide that only a joint resolution of both houses of the oireachtas may remove a judge although often referred to as the impeachment of a judge this procedure does not technically involve impeachment other jurisdictions austria the austrian federal president can be impeached by the federal convention bundesversammlung before the constitutional court the constitution also provides for the recall of the president by a referendum neither of these courses has ever been taken brazil the president of federative republic of brazil can be impeached this happened to fernando collor de mello due to evidences of bribery and misappropriation germany the federal president of germany can be impeached by the bundestag for willfully violating german law once the bundestag impeaches the president the federal constitutional court decides whether to remove him or her from office no such case has yet occurred norway members of government representatives of the national assembly stortinget and supreme court judges can be impeached for criminal offences tied to their duties and committed in office according to th constitution of one eight one four eight six and eight seven the procedural rules were modelled on the us rules and are quite similar to them impeachment has been used eight times since one eight one four last in one nine two seven many argue that impeachment has fallen into desuetude presidents who were removed from office following impeachment fernando collor de mello

the breed smooth long and wire of which the most common is the smooth haired long haired ibizans are considered rare appearance the ibizan hound has no black on its body they are either red or white or a combination of red and white its nose is flesh coloured as is its ears its eyes are a striking amber colour the ibizan may range in height from two four to two nine inches and weigh from four five to six zero pounds the breed has a pronounced sensitivity to cold their hair providing little in the way of insulation history for many years this breed was considered one of the oldest dog breeds it was believed the ibizan hound originated in ancient egypt as pictures that appear to be of ibizan hounds have been seen on the walls of ancient pyramids however according to dr elaine ostrander a geneticist at the fred hutchinson cancer research center and university of washington recent dna analysis reveals that this breed is actually a recent construction bred to resemble an older form in a study directed by dr ostrander with the aid of her colleague dr leonid kruglyak they have found genetic variations that allow them to distinguish among eight five dog breeds and to identify an individual dog s breed with nine nine percent accuracy according to mark derr a science writer for the new york times we can assign a dog to a breed but we can t tell what behavior it will have asserts ostrander there is huge variation in behavior between dogs within breeds the results of the study published in may two zero zero four in science magazine may help in the study of disease both canine and human because certain breeds are prone to some of the same genetic diseases as humans wherever it may have actually originated the breed were used to hunt rabbits and other small game in ibiza the ibizan hound is a fast dog that can hunt on all types of terrain working by sight sound and scent spanish hunters run these dogs in mostly female packs with perhaps a male or two as the female is the better hunter this breed is similar to the pharaoh hound but the ibizan hound is larger and can have a multicolored hair pattern the ibizan hound was fully recognized by the akc in one nine seven nine dog breeds sight hounds the irish wolfhound is a breed of hound a sighthound bred to hunt the name originates from its purpose rather than from its appearance to hunt wolves appearance these dogs are the tallest breed with a swift pace and good sight they have a rough coat gray brindle red black pure white or fawn a large arrow shaped head and a long muscular neck the irish wolfhound features in gaelic mythology with cuchaillin having a nice big dog the irish wolfhound is usually known as the tallest dog in the world averaging up to eight six cm three four inches at the withers a fact that sometimes is its biggest disadvantage when attracting owners who have no concern for its special needs as with all breeds the ideal and accepted measurements vary somewhat from one standard to another and there will always be individuals whose size falls outside these standards however generally breeders aim for a height averaging three two to three four inches eight one cm to eight six cm in male dogs two to four inches five to one zero cm less for bitches acceptable weight minimums range from one zero five lb four eight kg for bitches to one two zero lb five four kg for males temperament in temperament they are considered gentle and friendly very calm in the house enjoying long sleeps but energetic when taken for walks despite their great size and sometimes intimidating appearance wolfhounds are sensitive and should be corrected firmly but without anger they should be socialized from a young age so that they have a chance to gather experience while historically wolfhounds should show a strong guarding instinct most modern irish wolfhounds are not temperamentally suited to be a guard dog irish guards mascot in parade dress health wolfhounds should not receive additional supplements when a good dog chow is used it is generally accepted that they should be fed a large breed puppy food until one eight months of age and then change to a large breed adult food by the age of eight months the dogs appear adult and many owners start stressing them too much outstretched limbs and irreparable damage are the result wolfhounds need at least one eight months to be ready for lure coursing running as a sport and other strenuous activities heart disease and bone cancer are the leading cause of death and like all deep chested dogs gastric torsion bloat is always a possibility otherwise they are generally a healthy dog with few if any breed specific illnesses the average lifespan is around six to seven years though breeders are doing their best to increase this with some animals now reaching one zero years or more history the breed is very old possibly from the one st century bc or earlier bred as war dogs by the ancient celts who called them c faoil the irish continued to breed them for this purpose as well as to guard their homes and protect their stock regular references of irish wolfhounds being used in dog fights are found in many historical sagas cuchulain s favourite luath was slain by a southern chief s hound phorp while many modern texts state irish wolfhounds were used for coursing deer contemporary pre revival accounts such as animated nature one seven nine six by oliver goldsmith are explicit that the original animal was a very poor coursing dog their astonishing size speed and intelligence made them ideal hunting animals for both wild boar and wolves and many were exported for this purpose they were perhaps too ideal as the wolf is now extinct in ireland the irish wolfhound has been recorded as being exhibited in ancient rome to some excitement and mention is made that they so amazed and terrified the romans that it was seen fit to only transport them in cages there exists stories that in the arena the original wolfhound was the equal of a lion during times of conflict with england it was not uncommon for wolfhounds to be trained to take armored knights off of their horses thus allowing an infantry man to move in and finish the kill if the wolfhound has not done so already due to a massive export into various countries as a gift for royalty and a ban that allowed only royalty to own such a dog the breed almost vanished in the middle of the one nine th century captain graham rebred the irish wolfhound with the deerhound great dane borzoi and other breeds this saved the breed but had the inevitable effect of altering its appearance the ancient breed often referred to as the irish wolfdogge in contemporary accounts was available in both a smooth and rough coated variety descriptions of its appearance and demeanor as well as the method of its use place it closer to the flock guardians in appearance than the modern breed the historical variety was famed for its loyalty discernment grave nature and aggression in terms of temperament the modern breed has been greatly mellowed miscellaneous an irish wolfhound serves as the regimental mascot to the irish guards in england and accompanies the regiment in all of its parades the skulls of several irish wolfhounds were recovered in excavations of the ruins of emain macha these skulls are now in the possession of the royal irish academy no reconstruction appears to have been done to establish the appearance of these progenitors of the breed famous wolfhounds centaur pendragon pet of rudolph valentino the

of the toy group appearance the italian greyhound is the smallest of the sight hounds typically weighing three to five kg they look like miniature greyhounds the colour of the coat is a subject of much discussion in england the usa and australia white spotted italians are accepted while the fci standards adhered to in europe allows white spots only on the chest and paws the modern italian greyhound s appearance is a result of breeders throughout europe particularly austrian german italian and french breeders making great contributions to the forming of this breed the italian greyhound should resemble a small greyhound or rather a sloughi it is important that the dogs are significantly more elegant and graceful than these breeds though temperament the italian greyhound is considered a good companion dog as they are very affectionate the italian greyhound s apparent lack of wide appeal is possibly because of their fragile appearance with their spindly legs the reality of the breed is quite contrary to the appearance though as they are frequently described as a big dog in a small package they also have a realatively loud bark in fact the breed will be equally at home in a city and in the country and it does not require as much exercise as larger breeds the italian greyhound is hardy rarely ill intelligent and easy to teach sometimes ig s will make a resonably good guard dog and bark at things that aren t usually in the street they may also bark at passers by ig s often get along with cats so if you already have a cat and you are looking for a suitable dog which won t chase your beloved kitty all day long ig s can be recommended ig s despise the wind wet and cold and will sometimes refuse to do their business outside if it is raining so some recommend having some old newspaper on the floor near the exit this breed like most dogs is not a fussy eater and will eat almost anything including the month old scraps from your garden most will eat enthusiastically but some get more picky about their food as they age igs are good with kids but their thin bones are fragile and can be hurt by rough play from young children dogs of this breed have an almost odour free easily managed coat although the coat is incredibly short it can shed the breed simply loves the company of people and will promptly occupy your lap if you let it in fact many owners of this breed have them sleeping with them in their beds the young dog will often be particularly active and this high level of activity sometimes lead them to try to fly from furniture or stairs it is important to keep a close eye on the dogs in this initial phase as their young bones are still fragile the first year of life is the most accident prone although the graceful legs often seem to withstand incredible punishment they are not invulnerable igs love to run as fast as they possibly can and like all dogs it s important that they have an opportunity to run full out at least once daily either in the back yard or under supervision and control in a larger area like most dogs they enjoy digging and if left to their own devices for entertainment and exercise might resort to digging or other destructive behavior like most smaller breeds the italian greyhound can be difficult to housebreak this will normally come along with patience and training but at a slower pace than most other breeds patience is the only way to help the training along and remember that the breed is small and as such the dog will have a small bladder health members of this breed might love the sunlight so owners need to ensure that they don t become overheated and they do get sunburned particularly on their heads and bellies so it s recommended to use sunscreen on them the breed is relatively free of disease but the following ailments do occur epilepsy legg perthes disease degeneration of the hip patellar luxation slipped stifles osteoporosis von willebrand disease vwd bleeding disorder progressive retinal atrophy pra broken bones are common as well the tails of the italian greyhound are delicate and fragile be careful when handling a dog such as the italian greyhound and always supervise children who are playing with this breed history the name of the breed is a reference to the breed s popularity in renaissance italy mummified dogs very similar to the italian greyhound or small greyhounds have been found in egypt and pictorials of small greyhounds have been found in pompeii and they were probably the only accepted companion dog there as an amusing aside the expression cave canem beware of the dog was a warning to visitors not that the dogs would attack but to beware of damaging the small dogs although the small dogs are mainly companionship dogs they have in fact been used for hunting purposes often in combination with hunting falcons miscellaneous the grace of the breed has prompted several artists to include the dogs in paintings among others velasquez pisanello and giotto the breed has been popular with royalty throughout among the best known royal aficionados were mary stuart queen anne queen victoria catherine the great frederick the great and the norwegian queen maud activities some italian greyhounds enjoy dog agility the breed s lithe body and its love of action enable it to potentially do well at this sport although not many igs participate and their natural inclination is for straight out racing rather than for working tightly as a team with a handler on a technical course lure coursing is another activity well fitted to the italian greyhound and they seem to enjoy it tremendously although the italian greyhound is a very fast dog it is not as well suited to racing as its larger cousin dog breeds sight hounds information

award winning musical featuring a score by stephen sondheim and book by james lapine it debuted in san diego at the old globe theatre in one nine eight six and premiered on broadway in one nine eight seven bernadette peters performance as the witch and joanna gleason s portrayal of the baker s wife brought acclaim to the production during its original broadway run and in a year dominated by the phantom of the opera into the woods won several tony awards including best score although not a large part the witch has attracted numerous name actresses in major productions including ellen foley phylicia rashad nancy dussault and vanessa williams inspired by bruno bettelheim s the uses of enchantment the musical intertwines a collection of uncensored versions of one eight th century brothers grimm fairy tales an original story involving a baker and his wife s quest to begin a family ties together the stories of little red ridinghood jack of jack and the beanstalk rapunzel and cinderella act i opens with a wish a witch and a curse each separate tale intertwines throughout the story each depending on a weakness or strength of another the play s conflicts are motivated by selfish wishes made for the betterment of individual characters act ii explores what happens after happily ever after when these wishes have come true the land is ravaged by a giant whose husband was killed when jack chopped down the beanstalk the show explores the consequences of actions taken in the first act and the need for community in order to survive the woods among the many messages expressed in the musical one of the strongest is that unless people are gathering for one mission the mission cannot be accomplished as long as each is egocentric notable songs in the musical include into the woods hello little girl i know things now giants in the sky it takes two agony stay with me on the steps of the palace ever after happy moments in the woods your fault the last midnight no more no one is alone and children will listen the musical makes heavy use of syncopated speech in many instances the characters lines are delivered with a fixed beat that follows natural speech rhythms but is also purposely composed in eighth sixteenth and quarter note rhythms as part of a spoken song like many sondheim lapine productions the songs contain thought process narrative where characters converse or think aloud see lyric examples for detail plot summary act i in act i the major characters are introduced by the narrator along with their respective wishes cinderella wishes to attend the king s festival jack wishes for his pet cow milky white to give milk and the baker and his wife wish for a child cinderella s stepsisters mock her desire to attend the ball and jack s mother insists that jack must sell his beloved cow the baker and his wife are visited by little red ridinghood who purchases bread to bring to her granny in the woods shortly after the witch from next door appears and informs the baker and his wife that she has cursed his lineage with infertility in retaliation for the baker s father having stolen greens from her garden many years ago the witch reveals that the baker s father was fetching greens to satisfy his pregnant wife s cravings the witch punished the baker s parents by claiming the child for her own a girl who is later revealed to be rapunzel the baker s father also stole magic beans from the witch s garden and it is for this crime that she cursed his lineage the witch grants them a way to reverse their barren fate sending them into the forest to fetch four ingredients for a certain potion the cow as white as milk the cape as red as blood the hair as yellow as corn and the slipper as pure as gold they spend the rest of act i on a quest to locate these items meanwhile cinderella and rapunzel are each pursued by a prince a mysterious man roams the woods harassing jack and the baker and little red ridinghood encounters a seemingly friendly wolf on the path to granny s the wolf persuades little red ridinghood to tarry on her way and he races ahead to her granny s house the baker and his wife encounter jack and persuade him to trade his cow in exchange for the magic beans stolen from the witch the baker also encounters little red ridinghood and after she refuses to give him her cape he attempts to steal it but is rebuffed by her loud tantrum little red ridinghood reaches her destination to find her granny has been replaced and devoured by the wolf who then eats her fortunately the baker is at hand and kills the wolf freeing little red ridinghood and her granny in exchange for rescuing her little red ridinghood gives the baker her red cloak jack s mother throws away the magic beans which grow into a large beanstalk jack then climbs the beanstalk retrieving many riches from the home of the giants eventually he cuts down the beanstalk felling the giant the baker s wife encounters cinderella who is attempting to escape from the prince she notices cinderella s golden slippers eventually persuading cinderella to part with them she also encounters rapunzel s prince visiting her tower and by observing him learns the secret of retrieving rapunzel s corn yellow hair after escaping with a section of the hair she reunites with her husband and with some difficulty the potion is created the spell is lifted the mysterious man is revealed to be the baker s father who then dies and the witch regains the youth and beauty that she lost on the night that the beans were stolen from her but at the cost of losing her powers cinderella and rapunzel eventually get their princes jack gets his cow back and the act ends with everyone elated at the granting of their wishes with the exception of cinderella s stepsisters who have been blinded by birds act ii in act ii sheer fairy tale chaos ensues the wife of the slain giant is rampaging the land searching for jack she storms through the baker s village destroying the witch s garden little red ridinghood arrives at the baker s house shortly thereafter announcing that her mother was killed when their house was destroyed the witch young and beautiful again but lacking her former powers joins with them to search the forest and stop the giantess jack too sets off as he feels responsible for the onset of terror cinderella who has found contentment with the prince learns from the birds that something has happened to her mother s grave and she goes to investigate all the characters are once again out in the woods but for a different purpose this journey is motivated by a desire to repair damage done by the original selfish wishes gradually each character realizes that wishes made for one s own purpose and benefit quickly turn against expectations lack of unity amongst the characters causes several violent and unexpected deaths rapunzel is crushed by the giant after she runs towards her in hysterics of post partem depression after bearing twins to her prince jack s mother is killed by a blow to the head from the royal steward who is attempting to stop her from further angering and antagonizing the giant even the narrator is pulled into the story and thrown to the giant cinderella s father stepmother stepsisters and the steward little red ridinghood jack the witch the baker and his wife cluster together for safety the royal family leaves claiming to know a far away kingdom to escape to meanwhile the two princes who seemingly should be working to save everyone are instead singing of two new women whom they wish to pursue snow white and sleeping beauty the survivors consider their options deciding to split up in order to search for jack the baker s wife encounters cinderella s prince who seduces her shortly after he leaves she is crushed to death by a falling tree knocked astray by the giant all reconvene quickly discovering their diminishing numbers a fight ensues each attempting to place blame on anyone but themselves eventually they decide that the witch is to blame for raising the beans that grew the beanstalk to the giants world the witch after chastising them for being unable to accept that they are all responsible disappears in a puff of smoke leaving them alone as her final curse the baker overcome with grief leaves little red cinderella and jack and tries to run away from the woes of the woods he encounters his father who explains how life becomes even harder when you run with renewed resolve the baker finds the rest of the group again with only jack little red ridinghood cinderella the baker and his child left alive they concoct a scheme to slay the giant using what they have learned in their journey little red riding hood spreads pitch on the ground to trap the giant as the prince had done to cinderella on the stairs at the ball jack waits with the baker in a tree with a club as he had done to kill the giant s husband while waiting for the giant to return little red and jack realize that they are alone their mothers are both dead the baker and cinderella comfort the two children with the essential thesis of the show no one is alone when the giant comes looking for jack little red ridinghood calls attention to herself sending the giant toward jack s supposed hiding place cinderella stands by with the baker s child and calls to her bird friends who peck out the giant s eyes and jack slays her in the end they resolve to make a new life void of violence and selfishness but remain haunted by the memories of their loved ones it seems that everyone has learned that wishes can be dangerous however after the very last note cinderella steps forward from the ensemble and sings i wish indicating that humanity may be unable to exist apart from its

exons and introns introns for intragenic regions are sections of dna within a gene that do not encode part of the protein that the gene produces and are spliced out of the mrna that is transcribed from the gene before it is translated introns exist mainly in eukaryotic cells the regions of a gene that remain in the spliced mrna are called exons the number and length of introns varies widely among species for example the pufferfish takifugu rubripes has little intronic dna mammals and flowering plants on the other hand have numerous introns which are often much longer than the nearby exons introns sometimes allow for alternative splicing of a gene so that several different proteins that share some sections in common can be produced from a single gene the control of mrna splicing and hence of which alternative is produced is performed by a wide variety of signal molecules introns also sometimes contain old code sections of a gene that were probably once translated into protein but which are now discarded while most of the sequence in any given intron is junk dna with no known function several short sequences that are important for efficient splicing are known the exact mechanism for these intronic splicing enhancers is not well understood but it is thought that they serve as binding sites on the transcript for proteins that stabilize the spliceosome it is also possible that rna secondary structure formed by intronic sequences may have an effect on splicing the discovery of introns lead to the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in one nine nine three for phillip allen sharp and richard j roberts some introns such as group i and group ii introns are actually ribozymes that are capable of catalyzing their own splicing out of the primary rna transcript this self splicing was discovered by thomas cech who shared the one nine eight nine nobel prize in chemistry with sidney altman for the discovery of the catalytic properties of rna intron evolution there are two competing theories as to the evolutionary origin of introns which is usually studied in a highly conserved family of genes such as the actins in the introns early model ancestral genes are believed to have included a large number of introns some of which have been lost over evolutionary time leading to the different but similar intron patterns in related genes of different species the introns late model suggests instead that introns occur in the same location in variants of a given gene because the location is in some way predisposed to the introduction of an intron and therefore that a similar intron pattern may arise in two different species by a form of convergent evolution see also selfish dna noncoding dna intein alternate splicing reference walter gilbert one

including espionage business intelligence criminal intelligence military intelligence identical particles or indistinguishable particles are particles that cannot be distinguished from one another even in principle species of identical particles include elementary particles such as electrons as well as composite microscopic particles such as atoms there are two main categories of identical particles bosons which can share quantum states and fermions which are forbidden from sharing quantum states this property of fermions is known as the pauli exclusion principle examples of bosons are photons gluons phonons and helium four atoms examples of fermions are electrons neutrinos quarks protons and neutrons and helium three atoms the fact that particles can be identical has important consequences in statistical mechanics calculations in statistical mechanics rely on probabilistic arguments which are sensitive to whether or not the objects being studied are identical as a result identical particles exhibit markedly different statistical behavior from distinguishable particles for example the indistinguishability of particles has been proposed as a solution to gibb s mixing paradox distinguishing between particles there are two ways in which one might distinguish between particles the first method relies on differences in the particles intrinsic physical properties such as mass electric charge and spin if differences exist we can distinguish between the particles by measuring the relevant properties however it is an empirical fact that microscopic particles of the same species have completely equivalent physical properties for instance every electron in the universe has exactly the same electric charge this is why we can speak of such a thing as the charge of the electron even if the particles have equivalent physical properties there remains a second method for distinguishing between particles which is to track the trajectory of each particle as long as we can measure the position of each particle with infinite precision even when the particles collide there would be no ambiguity about which particle is which the problem with this approach is that it contradicts the principles of quantum mechanics according to quantum theory the particles do not possess definite positions during the periods between measurements instead they are governed by wavefunctions that give the probability of finding a particle at each position as time passes the wavefunctions tend to spread out and overlap once this happens it becomes impossible to determine in a subsequent measurement which of the particle positions correspond to those measured earlier the particles are then said to be indistinguishable quantum mechanical description of identical particles symmetrical and antisymmetrical states we will now make the above discussion concrete using the formalism developed in the article on the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics for simplicity consider a system composed of two identical particles as the particles possess equivalent physical properties their state vectors occupy mathematically identical hilbert spaces if we denote the hilbert space of a single particle as h then the hilbert space of the combined system is formed by the tensor product h h let n denote a complete set of discrete quantum numbers for specifying single particle states for example for the particle in a box problem we can take n to be the quantized wave vector of the wavefunction suppose that one particle is in the state n one and another is in the state n two what is the quantum state of the system we might guess that it is n one rang n two rang which is simply the canonical way of constructing a basis for a tensor product space from the individual spaces however this expression implies that we can identify the particle with n one as particle one and the particle with n two as particle two which conflicts with the ideas about indistinguishability discussed earlier actually it is an empirical fact that identical particles occupy special types of multi particle states called symmetric states and antisymmetric states symmetric states have the form n one n two s rang equiv mbox times bigg n one rang n two rang n two rang n one rang bigg antisymmetric states have the form n one n two a rang equiv mbox times bigg n one rang n two rang n two rang n one rang bigg note that if n one and n two are the same our equation for the antisymmetric state gives the zero ket which cannot be a state vector as it cannot be normalized in other words in an antisymmetric state the particles cannot occupy the same single particle states this is known as the pauli exclusion principle and it is the fundamental reason behind the chemical properties of atoms and the stability of matter exchange symmetry the importance of symmetric and antisymmetric states is ultimately based on empirical evidence it appears to be a fact of nature that identical particles do not occupy states of a mixed symmetry such as n one n two rang mbox times bigg n one rang n two rang i n two rang n one rang bigg there is actually an exception to this rule which we will discuss later on the other hand we can show that the symmetric and antisymmetric states are in a sense special by examining a particular symmetry of the multiple particle states known as exchange symmetry let us define a linear operator p called the exchange operator when it acts on a tensor product of two state vectors it exchanges the values of the state vectors p bigg psi rang phi rang bigg equiv phi rang psi rang p is both hermitian and unitary because it is unitary we can regard it as a symmetry operator we can describe this symmetry as the symmetry under the exchange of labels attached to the particles i e to the single particle hilbert spaces clearly p one the identity operator so the eigenvalues of p are one and one the corresponding eigenvectors are the symmetric and antisymmetric states p n one n two s rang n one n two s rang p n one n two a rang n one n two a rang in other words symmetric and antisymmetric states are essentially unchanged under the exchange of particle labels they are only multiplied by a factor of one or one rather than being rotated somewhere else in the hilbert space this indicates that the particle labels have no physical meaning in agreement with our earlier discussion on indistinguishability we have mentioned that p is hermitian as a result it can be regarded as an observable of the system which means that we can in principle perform a measurement to find out if a state is symmetric or antisymmetric furthermore the equivalence of the particles indicates that the hamiltonian can be written in a symmetrical form such as h frac frac u x one x two v x one v x two it is possible to show that such hamiltonians satisfy the commutation relation leftp h right zero according to the heisenberg equation this means that the value of p is a constant of motion if the quantum state is initially symmetric antisymmetric it will remain symmetric antisymmetric as the system evolves mathematically this says that the state vector is confined to one of the two eigenspaces of p and is not allowed to range over the entire hilbert space thus we might as well treat that eigenspace as the actual hilbert space of the system this is the idea behind the definition of fock space fermions and bosons the choice of symmetry or antisymmetry is determined by the species of particle for example we must always use symmetric states when describing photons or helium four atoms and antisymmetric states when describing electrons or protons particles which exhibit symmetric states are called bosons as we will see the nature of symmetric states has important consequences for the statistical properties of systems composed of many identical bosons these statistical properties are described as bose einstein statistics particles which exhibit antisymmetric states are called fermions as we have seen antisymmetry gives rise to the pauli exclusion principle which forbids identical fermions from sharing the same quantum state systems of many identical fermions are described by fermi dirac statistics parastatistics are also possible in certain two dimensional systems mixed symmetry can occur these exotic particles are known as anyons and they obey fractional statistics experimental evidence for the existence of anyons exists in the fractional quantum hall effect a phenomenon observed in the two dimensional electron gases that form the inversion layer of mosfets there is another type of statistic known as braid statistics which are associated with particles known as plektons the spin statistics theorem relates the exchange symmetry of identical particles to their spin it states that bosons have integer spin and fermions have half integer spin anyons possess fractional spin n particles the above discussion generalizes readily to the case of n particles suppose we have n particles with quantum numbers n one n two nn if the particles are bosons they occupy a totally symmetric state which is symmetric under the exchange of any two particle labels n one n two cdots n n s rang sqrt sum p n rang n rang cdots n rang here the sum is taken over all possible permutations p acting on n elements the square root on the right hand side is a normalizing constant the quantity nj stands for the number of times each of the single particle states appears in the n particle

if p is composed of an even number of transpositions and one if odd note that we have omitted the jnj term because each single particle state can appear only once in a fermionic state these states have been normalized so that lang n one n two cdots n n s n one n two cdots n n s rang one qquad lang n one n two cdots n n a n one n two cdots n n a rang one measurements of identical particles suppose we have a system of n bosons fermions in the symmetric antisymmetric state n one n two cdots n n s a rang and we perform a measurement of some other set of discrete observables m in general this would yield some result m one for one particle m two for another particle and so forth if the particles are bosons fermions the state after the measurement must remain symmetric antisymmetric i e

one mn to ensure that we do not count each multi particle state more than once wavefunction representation so far we have worked with discrete observables we will now extend the discussion to continuous observables such as the position x recall that an eigenstate of a continuous observable represents an infinitesimal range of values of the observable not a single value as with discrete observables for instance if a particle is in a state the probability of finding it in a region of volume d x surrounding some position x is lang x psi rang two d three x as a result the continuous eigenstates x are normalized to the delta function instead of unity lang x x rang delta three x x we can construct symmetric and antisymmetric multi particle states out of continuous eigenstates in the same way as before however it is customary to use a different normalizing constant x one x two cdots x n s rang frac sum p x rang x rang cdots x rang x one x two cdots x n a rang frac sum p mathrm

defined as usual by psi n x equiv lang x n rang the most important property of these wavefunctions is that exchanging any two of the coordinate variables changes the wavefunction by only a plus or minus sign this is the manifestation of symmetry and antisymmetry in the wavefunction representation psi cdots x i cdots x j cdots psi cdots x j cdots x i cdots psi cdots x i cdots x j cdots psi cdots

of finding particles in infinitesimal volumes near x one x two x n is n left psi x one x two cdots x n right two d x the factor of n comes from our normalizing constant which has been chosen so that by analogy with single particle wavefunctions int int cdots int left psi x one x two cdots x n right two d three x one d three x two cdots d three x n one because each integral runs over all possible values of x each multi particle state appears n times in the integral in other words the probability associated with each event is evenly distributed across n equivalent points in the integral space because it is usually more convenient to work with unrestricted integrals than restricted ones we have chosen our normalizing constant to reflect this finally it is interesting to note that that antisymmetric wavefunction can be written as the determinant of a matrix known as a slater determinant psi x one cdots x n frac left begin psi x one n denote the energy of a particle in state n as the particles do not interact the total energy of the system is the sum of the single particle energies the partition function of the system is z sum exp left left epsilon n one epsilon n two cdots epsilon n n right right where k is boltzmann s constant and t is the temperature we can factorize this expression to obtain z xi n where xi sum n exp left frac right if the particles are identical this equation is incorrect consider a state of the system described by the single particle states n one nn in the equation for z every possible permutation of the n s occurs once in the sum even though each of these permutations is describing the same multi particle state we have thus over counted the actual number of states if we neglect the possibility of overlapping states which is valid if the temperature is high then the number of times we count each state is approximately n the correct partition function is z frac note that this high temperature approximation does not distinguish between fermions and bosons the discrepancy in the partition functions of distinguishable and indistinguishable particles was known as far back as the one nine th century before the advent of quantum mechanics it leads to a difficulty known as the gibbs paradox gibbs showed that if we use the equation z n the entropy of a classical ideal gas is s n k ln left v right n f t where v is the volume of the gas and f is some function of t alone the problem with this result is that s is not extensive if we double n and v s does not double accordingly such a system does not obey the postulates of thermodynamics gibbs also showed that using z n n alters the result to s n k ln left frac right n f t which is perfectly extensive however the reason for this correction to the partition function remained obscure until the discovery of quantum mechanics statistical properties of bosons and fermions there are important differences between the statistical behavior of bosons and fermions which are described by bose einstein statistics and fermi dirac statistics respectively roughly speaking bosons have a tendency to clump into the same quantum state which underlies phenomena such as the laser bose einstein condensation and superfluidity fermions on the other hand are forbidden by the pauli exclusion principle from sharing quantum states giving rise to systems such as the fermi gas we can illustrate the differences between the statistical behavior of fermions bosons and distinguishable particles using a system of two particles let us call the particles a and b each particle can exist in two possible states labelled zero and one which have the same energy we let the composite system evolve in time interacting with a noisy environment because the zero and one states are energetically equivalent neither state is favored so this process has the effect of randomizing the states this is discussed in the article on quantum entanglement after some time the composite system will have an equal probability of occupying each of the states available to it we then measure the particle states if a and b are distinguishable particles then the composite system has four distinct states zero zero one one zero one and one zero the probability of obtaining two particles in the zero state is zero two five the probability of obtaining two particles in the one state is zero two five and the probability of obtaining one particle in the zero state and the other in the one state is zero five if a and b are identical bosons then the composite system has only three distinct states zero zero one one and two one two zero one one zero when we perform the experiment the probability of obtaining two particles in the zero state is now zero three three the probability of obtaining two particles in the one state is zero three three and the probability of obtaining one particle in the zero state and the other in the one state is zero three three note that the probability of finding particles in the same state is relatively larger than in the distinguishable case this demonstrates the tendency of bosons to clump if a and b are identical fermions there is only one state available to the composite system the totally antisymmetric state two one two zero one one zero when we perform the experiment we inevitably find that one particle is in the zero state and the other is in the one state the results are summarized in table one table one statistics of two particles particles both zero both one one zero and one one distinguishable zero two five zero two five zero five bosons zero three three zero three three zero three three fermions zero zero one as can be seen even a system of two particles exhibits different statistical behaviors between distinguishable particles bosons and fermions in the articles on fermi dirac statistics and bose einstein statistics these principles are extended to large number of particles with qualitatively similar results the homotopy class to understand why we have the statistics that we do for particles we first have to note that particles are point localized excitations and that particles that are spacelike separated do not interact in a flat d dimensional space m at any given time the configuration of two identical particles can be specified as an element of m m if there is no overlap between the particles so that they do not interact at the same time we are not referring to time delayed interactions here which are mediated at the speed of light or slower then we are dealing with the space m m the subspace with coincident points removed x y describes the configuration with particle i at x and particle ii at y y x describes the interchanged configuration with identical particles the state described by x y ought to be indistinguishable which isn t the same thing as identical from the state described by y x let s look at the homotopy class of continuous paths from x y to y x if m is r d where d geq three then this homotopy class only has one element if m is r two then this homotopy class has countably many elements i e a counterclockwise interchange by half a turn a counterclockwise interchange by one and a half turns two and a half turns etc a clockwise interchange by half a turn etc in particular a counterclockwise interchange by half a turn is not homotopic to a clockwise interchange by half a turn lastly if m is r then this homotopy class is empty obviously if m is not isomorphic to r d we can have more complicated homotopy classes what does this all mean let s first look at the case d geq three the universal covering space of m m which is none other than m m itself only has two points which are physically indistinguishable from x y namely x y itself and y x so the only permissible interchange is two swap both particles performing this interchange twice gives us x y back again if this interchange results in a multiplication by one then we have bose statistics and if this interchange results in a multiplication by one we have fermi statistics now how about r two the universal covering space of m m has infinitely many points which are physically indistinguishable from x y this is described by the infinite cyclic group generated by making a counterclockwise half turn interchange unlike the previous case performing this interchange twice in a row does not lead us back to the original state so such an interchange can generically result in a multiplication by exp i its absolute value is one because of unitarity this is called anyonic statistics in fact even with two distinguishable particles even though x y is now physically distinguishable from y x if we go over to the universal covering space we still end up with infinitely many points which are physically indistinguishable from the original point and the interchanges are generated by a counterclockwise rotation by one full turn which results in a multiplication by exp i this phase factor here is called the mutual statistics as for r even if particle i and particle ii are identical we can always distinguish between them by the labels the particle on the left and the particle on the right there is no interchange symmetry here and such particles are called plektons the generalization to n identical particles doesn t give us anything qualitatively new because they are generated from the exchanges of two identical particles particle physics permutations icd one zero icd nine icdo image caption omim medlineplus zero zero zero four

transferred to m s secretary miss moneypenny occasionally bond is assigned to work a case with his good friend felix leiter of the cia in the films leiter appeared regularly during the connery era only once during moore s tenure and in both dalton films however he was only played by the same actor twice bond s women particularly in the films often have double entendre names leading to coy jokes

dismissing him as an overgrown stuntman fleming liked his portrayal so much that he eventually added background to the character in the novels so that his father was scottish accounts vary wildly in regards to which actor was fleming s initial choice for the film version of bond sources have suggested that fleming favored roger moore james mason and cary grant among others according to sir john

fictional british people japanese is a language spoken by over one two seven million people mainly in japan but also by japanese emigrant communities around the world it is considered an agglutinative language and is distinguished by a complex system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical nature of japanese society with verb forms and particular vocabulary which indicate the relative status of speaker and listener the sound inventory of japanese is relatively small and it has a lexically distinctive pitch accent system japanese has been heavily influenced by chinese over a period of at least one five zero zero years japanese is written with a mix of chinese characters kanji and a modified syllabary kana also originally based on chinese characters much vocabulary has been imported from chinese or created on chinese models classification historical linguists who specialize in japanese agree that it is one of the two members of the japonic language family but remain divided as to the origins of the japonic languages an older view still widely held by some linguists and many non linguists is that japanese is a language isolate as for its relation to other languages there are several theories presented roughly in descending order of certainty japanese is a member of the altaic language family other languages in this group include mongolian tungusic turkish and according to most proponents korean evidence for this theory lies in the fact that like turkish and korean japanese is an agglutinative language additionally there are a suggestive number of apparently regular correspondences in basic vocabulary such as ishi stone to turkic da yon four to turkic d rt kura saddle to turkic k rt n kiru to cut to turkic kir inu dog to turkic it kuro black and kurai dark to turkic k l shadow etc these examples originate from this database which contains a comprehensive list of comparisons and theoretical altaic etymologies japanese is a relative of extinct languages spoken by historic cultures of korea and manchuria the best attested of these is the language of goguryeo a k a koguryo with the more poorly attested languages of baekje a k a paekche and buyeo a k a puyo hypothesized to also be related supporters of the buyeo languages theory generally do not include modern korean as part of that family because it is thought to have derived from the ancient language of silla the limited data on these languages as well as these cultures historic ties are the primary evidence this has been largely subsumed into the altaic theory japanese is a relative of korean this theory is based on the high degree of similarity between japanese and korean grammar proponents of this theory have also proposed japanese korean cognates the idea of a japanese korean relationship has been largely subsumed into the altaic theory japanese is a creole language phonological similarities and geographical proximity to austronesian languages have led to the theory that japanese may be a kind of creole with an altaic substratum and an austronesian superstratum or vice versa japanese is a purely austronesian language this theory enjoys little currency since the grammar and lexis of japanese are vastly different from those of any known austronesian language proponents of this theory point out examples of convergent lexis such as japanese hina doll and hime girl or princess as cognate with the m ori word hine girl or japanese kaku to write to scratch with the hawaiian k kau to write to tattoo however it is important to note that many totally unrelated languages exhibit chance occurences of convergent lexis susumu ohno and other linguists including r caidwell susumu shiba and fujiwara akira have suggested a possible relationship between japanese and tamil a member of the dravidian language family spoken in south india evidence for this theory is that japanese and tamil are both agglutinative languages and also have similar phonetics vocabularies and retroflex consonants specialists in japanese historical linguistics all agree that japanese is related to the ryukyuan languages including okinawan together japanese and ryukyuan are grouped in the japonic languages among these specialists the possibility of a genetic relation to goguryeo has the most evidence relationship to korean is considered plausible but is still up to debate the altaic hypothesis has somewhat less currency though it has grown significantly more respectable in recent years primarily due to the work of sergei starostin et al almost all specialists reject the idea that japanese could be genetically related to austronesian malayo polynesian languages or sino tibetan languages and the idea that japanese could be related to tamil is almost entirely excluded it should be noted that linguistic studies like all fields can be strongly affected by national politics and other non academic factors for example most linguists would say that romanian and moldovan are essentially the same language and that they are known as two different languages for political reasons japan s long standing rivalries and enmities with virtually all of its neighbours make the study of linguistic connection particularly fraught with such political tensions however these tensions are less prevalent among non japanese researchers geographic distribution although japanese is spoken almost exclusively in japan it has been and is still sometimes spoken in countries besides japan when japan occupied korea taiwan parts of china and various pacific islands locals in those countries were forced to learn japanese in empire building programmes as a result there are still many people in these countries who speak japanese instead of or as well as the local languages in addition emigrants from japan the majority of whom are found in brazil where the biggest japanese community outside japan is found australia especially sydney brisbane and melbourne and the united states notably california and hawaii also frequently speak japanese there is also a small community in davao philippines their descendants known as nikkei literally japanese descendants however rarely speak japanese fluently there are estimated to be several million non japanese studying the language as well official status japanese is the official language of japan and japan is the only country to have japanese as an official working language there are two forms of the language considered standard or standard japanese and or the common language as government policy has modernized japanese many of the distinctions between the two have blurred hy jungo is taught in schools and used on television and in official communications and is the version of japanese discussed in this article standard japanese can also be divided into or literary language and or oral language which have different rules of grammar and some variance in vocabulary bungo was the main method of writing japanese until the late one nine four zero s and still has relevance for historians literary scholars and lawyers many japanese laws that survived world war ii are still written in bungo although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language k go is the predominant method of speaking and writing japanese today although bungo grammar and vocabulary occasionally appears in modern japanese for poetic effect dialects dozens of dialects are spoken in japan the profusion is due to the mountainous island terrain and japan s long history of both external and internal isolation dialects typically differ in terms of pitch accent inflectional morphology vocabulary particle usage and pronunciation some even differ in vowel and consonant inventories although this is uncommon dialects from less central regions such as the t hoku or tsushima dialect may be unintelligible to speakers from other parts of the country the dialect used in kagoshima in southern ky sh is famous for being unintelligible not only to speakers of standard japanese but to speakers of nearby dialects elsewhere in ky sh as well kagoshima dialect is eight four cognate with standard tokyo dialect kansai ben a group of dialects from west central japan is spoken by many japanese the osaka dialect in particular is associated with comedy and many entertainers use osaka dialect phrases solely for humor value the ryukyuan languages are spoken in the ryukyu islands not only is each language unintelligible to japanese speakers but most are unintelligible to those who speak other ryukyuan languages due to the close relationship of ryukyuan and japanese they are still sometimes said to be only dialects of one language but modern scholars consider them to be separate languages recently standard japanese has become prevalent nationwide due not only to television and radio but also to increased mobility within japan due to its system of roads railways and airports young people usually speak their local dialect and the standard language though in most cases the local dialect is influenced by the standard and regional versions of standard japanese have local dialect influence sounds japanese vowels are pure sounds similar to their italian or spanish counterparts the only unusual vowel is the high back vowel which is like but unrounded japanese has five vowels and vowel length is phonemic so each one has both a short and a long version some japanese consonants have several allophones which may give the impression of a larger inventory of sounds however some of these allophones have since become phonemic for example in the japanese of the first half of the twentieth century was palatalized to approximately chi however now and are distinct as evidenced by words like paatii party and chi ground the syllabic structure and the phonotactics are very simple the only consonant clusters allowed within a syllable consist of one of a subset of the consonants plus y however consonant clusters across syllables within the word are common though limited in type grammar sentence structure the basic japanese word order is subject object verb subject and object are usually marked by particles which come after the word the basic sentence structure is topic comment for example kochira wa tanaka san desu kochira this is the topic of the sentence indicated by the particle wa the verb is desu is as a phrase tanaka san desu is the comment this sentence loosely translates to as for this person it is mr mrs ms tanaka thus japanese like chinese and korean is often called a topic prominent language which means it indicates the topic separately from the subject and the two do not always coincide the sentence z wa hana ga nagai literally means as for elephants their noses are long the topic is z elephant and the subject is hana nose japanese is a pro drop language meaning that the subject or object of a sentence need not be stated if it is obvious from context as a result japanese speakers tend to omit words from sentences rather than refer to them with pronouns in the context of the above example hana ga nagai would mean their noses are long while nagai by itself would mean they are long a single verb can be a complete sentence yatta i we they etc did it another well known example of omission is the sentence watashi wa supagetti desu which initially appears to mean i am spaghetti but in the context of a restaurant could also be an order for me it ll be spaghetti while the language has some pronouns such as personal pronouns these are not used as frequently as pronouns in indo european languages and function somewhat differently instead japanese typically relies on auxiliary verbs to indicate the direction of an action down to the speaker or persons related to the speaker or up to the listener or other person for example setsumei shite moratta literally i obtained explaining means he she explained it to me us similarly oshiete ageta literally taught handed up is commonly used to mean i we told him her such directional auxiliary verbs in japanese thus serve a function comparable to that of pronouns and prepositions in indo european languages japanese pronouns also function differently than indo european pronouns in that they can take modifiers as any other nouns may for instance you cannot say in english the big he ran down the street bad grammar but you can grammatically say essentially the same thing in japanese correct grammar this is partly due to the fact that japanese pronouns evolved from regular nouns as indirect references such as kimi you emperor anata you that side yonder and boku i servant this is why some linguists do not classify japanese pronouns as pure pronouns but rather as referential nouns japanese personal pronouns are generally used only in situations implying some emphasis the choice of pronouns used is correlated with the gender of the speaker and the social situation in which they are spoken women in a formal situation generally refer to themselves as watashi while men in rougher conversation are much more likely to use the word ore similarly different pronouns such as anata kimi and omae may be used to refer to a listener depending on the listener s relative social position and the degree of familiarity with the listener however it is impolite to use pronouns to refer to listeners who are strangers or social superiors inflection and conjugation japanese nouns have neither number nor gender thus hon may mean book or books it is possible to explicitly indicate more than one either by providing a quantity often with a counter word or by adding a suffix which is rare words for people are usually understood as singular thus tanaka san usually means mr ms tanaka words that refer to people and animals can be made to indicate a group of individuals with noun suffixes that indicate groups such as tachi though some words like hitobito people always refer to more than one japanese nouns without such additions are neither singular nor plural hito could mean person or persons ki could be tree or trees without any implied preference for singular or plural verbs are conjugated to show tenses of which there are two past and present or non past which is used for the present and the future for some verbs that represent an ongoing process the te iru form indicates a continuous or progressive tense for others that represent a change of state the te iru form indicates a perfect tense for example kite iru means he has come and is still here but tabete iru means he is eating questions both with an interrogative pronoun and yes no questions have the same structure as affirmative sentences but with intonation rising at the end in the formal register the question particle ka is added for example ii desu it is ok becomes ii desu ka is it ok in a more informal tone sometimes the particle no is added instead to show a personal interest of the speaker d shite konai no why aren t you coming some simple queries are formed simply by mentioning the topic with an interrogative intonation to call for the hearer s attention kore wa what about this namae wa what s your name negatives are formed by inflecting the verb for example pan o taberu i will eat bread or i eat bread becomes pan o tabenai i will not eat bread or i do not eat bread the so called te verb form is used for a variety of purposes either progressive or perfect aspect see above combining verbs in a temporal sequence asagohan o tabete sugu dekakeru i ll eat breakfast and leave at once simple commands conditional statements and permissions dekakete mo ii may i go out etc the word da plain desu polite is the copula verb it corresponds approximately to the english be but often takes on other roles two additional common verbs are used to indicate existence there is or in some contexts property aru negative nai and iru negative inai for inanimate and animate things respectively for example neko ga iru there s a cat ii kangae ga nai i haven t got a good idea the verb to do suru polite form shimasu is often used to make verbs from nouns ai suru to love benky suru to study etc japanese also has a huge number of compound verbs to express concepts that are described in english using a verb and a preposition e g tobidasu to fly out to flee from tobu to fly to jump dasu to go out there are three types of adjective keiy shi or i adjectives which have a conjugating ending i such as atsui to be hot which can become past atsukatta it was hot or negative atsuku nai it is not hot note that nai is also an i adjective which can become past atsuku nakatta it was not hot atsui hi a hot day keiy d shi or na adjectives which are followed by a form of the copula usually na for example hen strange hen na hito a strange person rentaishi also called true adjectives such as onaji the same onaji hi the same day both keiy shi and keiy d shi may predicate sentences for example gohan ga atsui the rice is hot kare wa hen da he s strange both inflect though they do not show the full range of conjugation found in true verbs the rentaishi are few in number and unlike the other words are limited to modifying nouns they never predicate sentences examples include ookina big and onaji the same although there is a noun onaji that can be followed by da as in onaji da both keiy d shi and keiy shi form adverbs by following with ni in the case of keiy d shi hen ni naru become strange and by changing i to ku in the case of keiy shi atsuku naru become hot the grammatical function of nouns is indicated by postpositions also called particles these include for example no for possession or nominalizing phrases watashi no kamera my camera sukii ni iku no ga suki desu i like going skiing ga for subject kare ga yatta he did it o for direct object nani o tabemasu ka what will you eat ni for indirect object tanaka san ni kiite kudasai please ask mr ms tanaka wa for the topic watashi wa tai ry ri ga ii desu as for me thai food is good note that english generally makes no distinction between sentence topic and subject politeness unlike most western languages japanese has an extensive grammatical system to express politeness and formality broadly speaking there are three main politeness levels in spoken japanese the plain form kudaketa or futsuu the simple polite form teineigo and the advanced polite form keigo since most relationships are not equal in japanese society one person typically has a higher position this position is determined by a variety of factors including job age experience or even psychological state e g a person asking a favour tends to do so politely the person in the lower position is expected to use a polite form of speech whereas the other might use a more plain form strangers will also speak to each other politely japanese children rarely use polite speech until they are teens at which point they are expected to begin speaking in a more adult manner see uchi soto the plain form in japanese is recognized by the shorter dictionary form of verbs and the da form of the copula at the teinei level verbs end with the helping verb masu and the copula desu is used the advanced polite form keigo actually consists of two kinds of politeness honorific language sonkeigo and humble kenj go language whereas teineigo is an inflectional system keigo often employs many special often irregular honorific and humble verb forms iku to go becomes ikimasu in polite form but is replaced by mairimasu in humble form and irrashaimasu in honorific form the difference between honorific and humble speech is particularly pronounced in the japanese language humble language is used to talk about oneself or one s own group company family whilst honorific language is mostly used when describing the interlocutor and his group for example the san suffix mr mrs or ms is an example of honorific language it is not used to talk about oneself or when talking about someone from one s company to an external person since the company is the speaker s group most nouns in the japanese language may be made polite by the addition of o or go as a prefix o is generally used for words of native japanese origin whereas go is affixed to words of chinese derivation in some cases the prefix has become a fixed part of the word and is included even in regular speech such as gohan cooked rice meal such a construction often indicates deference to either the item s owner or to the object itself for example the word tomodachi friend would become o tomodachi when referring to the friend of someone of higher status though mothers often use this form to refer to their children s friends on the other hand a female speaker may sometimes refer to mizu water as o mizu merely to show politeness this contrasts with the more abrupt speech of men though men may also use very polite forms when speaking to superiors see gender differences in spoken japanese most japanese people employ politeness to indicate a lack of familiarity that is they use polite forms for new acquaintances but if a relationship becomes more intimate they no longer use them this occurs regardless of age social class or gender many researchers report that since the one nine nine zero s the use of polite forms has become rarer needless to say many older people disapprove of this trend young people usually receive extensive training in the proper use of polite language when they start to work for a company vocabulary the original language of japan was the so called yamato kotoba in addition to this original language japanese also has a great number of words that were either borrowed from chinese or constructed on chinese patterns these words entered the language from the fifth century onwards via contact with chinese culture chinese based words comprise as much as seventy percent of the total vocabulary of the japanese language and form as much as thirty to forty percent of words used in speech a much smaller number of words has been borrowed from korean and ainu japan has also borrowed a number of words from other languages gairaigo this began with borrowings from portuguese in the one six th century followed by borrowing from dutch during japan s long isolation of the edo period with the meiji restoration and the reopening of japan in the one nine th century borrowing occurred from german french and english currently words of english origin are the most commonly borrowed in the meiji era the japanese also coined many neologisms using chinese patterns to translate western concepts the chinese and koreans imported many of these pseudo chinese words into chinese korean and vietnamese via their kanji characters in the late one nine th and early two zero th century for example seiji politics and kagaku chemistry as a result japanese chinese korean and vietnamese share a large common corpus of vocabulary in the same way a large number of greco roman words is shared among european languages in the past few decades wasei eigo made in japan english has become a prominent phenomenon words such as wanpataan origin of the japanese people and language north

morrison see james morrison james douglas jim morrison december eight one nine four three three july one nine seven one was a singer songwriter writer and poet born in melbourne florida he was the lead singer and lyricist of the popular american rock band the doors and is considered to be one of the most charismatic frontmen in the history of rock music he was also an author of several poetry books a documentary short film and an early music video the unknown soldier although morrison never married he called his long time girlfriend pamela courson his cosmic mate and in his will left his entire estate to her biography early years of scottish ancestry morrison was the son of admiral george stephen morrison and his wife clara clark morrison who met in hawaii in one nine four two where steve morrison then an ensign was stationed in one nine four three a pregnant clara morrison moved to clearwater florida to live with her in laws while her husband was trained as a pilot at a nearby base for the united states navy once his flight training was complete he left to serve in the pacific front for the duration of world war ii clara stayed in florida with her new son in time morrison would find himself with a younger sister anne and a brother andy as might be expected in a military household morrison s father and grandparents were strict disciplinarians but morrison related with some amusement and irony that when his father was at home it was clara who was the admiral s commanding officer according to morrison one of the most important events of his life came about in one nine four seven during a family trip in new mexico he described the event as follows the first time i discovered death me and my mother and father and my grandmother and grandfather were driving through the desert at dawn a truckload of indians had either hit another car or something there were indians scattered all over the highway bleeding to death i was just a kid so i had to stay in the car while my father and grandfather went to check it out i didn t see nothing all i saw was funny red paint and people lying around but i knew something was happening because i could dig the vibrations of the people around me and all of a sudden i realized that they didn t know what was happening any more than i did that was the first time i tasted fear and i do think at that moment the souls of those dead indians maybe one or two of them were just running around freaking out and just landed in my soul and i was like a sponge ready to sit there and absorb it morrison would later revisit this event in the bridge to the song peace frog indians scattered on dawn s highway bleeding ghosts crowd the young child s fragile egg shell mind both the admiral and mrs morrison claimed that event never happened morrison graduated from george washington high school in alexandria virginia in june one nine six one the admiral and family were transferred to southern california that august morrison was sent to live once again with his paternal grandparents in clearwater florida where he attended classes at st petersburg junior college the move made economic sense since morrison s father maintained his permanent residence at his parent s address in florida a common arrangement for those with a career in military service this would enable morrison to attend the florida colleges for a reduced tuition but living with his strict tea totalling grandparents was difficult for the alcohol loving morrison he later transferred to florida state university one nine six two one nine six three which still afforded a favorable tuition but was too far away for a reasonable commute morrison thus moved close to the f s u campus where for a time he was a roommate of george greer and appeared in a school recruitment film in january one nine six four over his parent s objections morrison finally headed for los angeles california where he completed his undergraduate education at ucla majoring in film artistic roots as a naval family the morrisons relocated frequently consequently morrison s early education was routinely disrupted as he moved from school to school nonetheless he proved to be an intelligent and capable student drawn to the study of literature poetry religion philosophy and psychology among other fields morrison s penchant for academic pursuits is greatly overshadowed by his reputation as a rebel and hedonist but these interests are clearly reflected in his development as a poet lyricist and are essential to understanding his vision for musical performance coupled with elements of theater biographers have consistently pointed to a number of writers and philosophers who influenced morrison s thinking and perhaps behavior while still in his teens morrison discovered the works of existentialist philosopher friedrich nietzche he was also drawn to the dark symbolist poets of the one nine th century notably the british poet william blake and the french poets charles baudelaire and arthur rimbaud beat generation writers such as jack kerouac also had a strong influence on morrison s outlook and manner of expression morrison was eager to experience the life described in kerouac s on the road and went about doing so he was similarly drawn to the works of the french beat writer louis ferdinand destouches known as c line c line s book voyage au bout de la nuit journey to the end of the night and blake s auguries of innocence both echo through one of morrison s haunting early songs end of the night morrison s vision of the art and psychology of performance was colored by the works of two zero th century french playwright antonin artaud author of theater and its double and by julien beck s living theater with the doors morrison on the best of the doors album cover in one nine six five after graduating from film school at ucla morrison led a bohemian lifestyle in nearby venice beach due to a regime of little food and lots of lsd by one nine six six the formerly pudgy morrison had trimmed down to the chiseled rock god immortalised in the famed series of black and white photos taken by photographer joel brodsky known as the young lion photo session it included the iconic bare chested christ pose a shot that was featured on the best of the doors lp cover shown at right morrison wowed fellow ucla student ray manzarek with a reading of his lyrics for moonlight drive and the two formed the doors they were soon joined by drummer john densmore guitarist robby krieger auditioned at densmore s recommendation and was immediately added to the lineup the doors sound was a significant innovation dominated by morrison s deep sonorous baritone voice against the interplay of manzarek s keyboards krieger s flamenco and classically influenced guitar style and densmore s crisp fluid drumming the doors were unique because they didn t have a bass guitar in the lineup manzarek provided bass lines on his newly released fender keyboard bass a small bass scale version of the famous fender electric piano although the group did augment their studio recordings with bass players including lonnie mack the doors appeared as a four piece in concert apart from occasions when they were joined by special guests such as john sebastian the name the doors came from an aldous huxley book the doors of perception which in its turn borrowed from a line of poetry by william blake if the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is infinite a door can be seen as a transition between two worlds you don t know what s going on in the other world until you cross that transition as morrison put it there are things known and things unknown and in between are the doors morrison famously lived by another quote also from william blake the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom even before he formed the doors he took copious amounts of lsd in the band s early years but soon switched to alcohol which he began to consume in herculean proportions and he reportedly indulged in various bacchanalia he would sometimes show up for recording sessions extremely inebriated he can be heard hiccuping on the song five to one the doors were first noticed on the national level in the spring of one nine six seven after signing to the elektra records label the single light my fire written by krieger hit number one in june one nine six seven three months later the doors appeared on the ed sullivan show a popular sunday night variety series that had once introduced a young wriggling elvis presley and later the beatles to the united states by the release of their second album strange days the doors had became one of the most popular rock bands in the united states their blend of blues jazz and rock had never before been heard the doors eclectic repertoire included a swag of stunning original songs and distinctive cover versions such as the memorable rendition of alabama song from bertholt brecht and kurt weill s operetta rise and fall of the city of mahagonny the four also broke new ground in rock music with their extended concept works including the famous epic songs the end and when the music s over and the extended suite which they played in concert the celebration of the lizard lyrically the doors also broke new ground in rock music with morrison s complex surrealist allusive lyrics exploring themes of sex mysticism drugs murder madness and death although morrison is known as the lyricist this is in fact a misnomer and morrison himself was always at pains to point out the significant contributions made by krieger who wrote or co wrote some of the group s biggest hits including light my fire and touch me among morrison s more famous nicknames are mr mojo risin an anagram of his name which he eventually used as a refrain in his final single la woman and the lizard king from a line in his famed epic poem celebration of the lizard part of which appeared on the doors one nine six eight album waiting for the sun and which was finally captured in full on the absolutely live double lp in one nine six nine it was subsequently adapted into a musical in the one nine nine zero s by the late one nine six zero s the pressure of pop stardom was taking its toll on morrison and the formerly svelte five one one singer began to balloon out due to his rapidly escalating drinking although the cover of the one nine seven zero absolutely live lp depicts a trim clean shaven leather trousered morrison on the front this photo had in fact been taken about two years earlier by the time of the tour on which the live album was recorded morrison was two zero pounds heavier one seven five pounds it was during this time that he tried to get away from the lizard king image he grew a beard and started wearing regular slacks and jeans and t shirts during a one nine six nine concert at the dinner key auditorium in miami an intoxicated morrison was charged and ultimately convicted of indecent exposure and open profanity fallout from that event resulted in much negative publicity and the cancellation of many of the doors scheduled concerts following morrison s conviction the doors began to change direction with the production and successful release of the morrison hotel hard rock cafe lp it featured much grittier blues based sound and saw the group returning to their blues and r texas radio and the big beat and the album s epic closer riders on the storm which instantly became an fm radio staple the l a woman album also signalled another major change in the group s recording career shortly after sessions began producer paul a rothchild who had overseen all their previous recordings walked off the project disenchanted with the band s new material which he dismissed as lounge music and was bored after the band ran through the material in a bad manner long serving engineer bruce botnick took over and produced an album which many fans consider their best after their one nine six seven debut it also displayed a growing maturity in morrison s singing amusingly several of his vocals were performed in the toilets at the doors offices due to the excellent reverberation personal life family relationships jim s early life was a nomadic existence typical of military families although his father was a figure of great authority his official duties caused him to be absent much of the time thus it was morrison s mother clara who became the dominant personality in the morrison household biographers record that during his youth morrison was a dutiful and respectful son who excelled at school and greatly enjoyed swimming and other outdoor activities this perfect picture was not to last by the time of morrison s ascent to the top of the music charts in one nine six seven he had not been in communication with his family for more than a year and falsely claimed that his parents and siblings were dead this misinformation was published as part of the materials distributed with the first doors album as recounted in no one here gets out alive during a doors concert that his mother attended morrison refused to speak with her or meet her and threatened to refuse to perform if she remained in the audience ultimately he was convinced to go on stage where during the violent oedipal section of the song the end he turned to her with an ugly sneer and shouted out the notorious lyrics these events have caused many to assume that there was great animosity within the family and that the frightening lyrics that painted a bloody picture of murder rape and incest were if not exactly factual representative of morrison s feelings and suggested a pathological family background while it is tempting to read a poet s work as autobiography it is not often a very productive endeavor particularly when the author writes about the dark side of human nature although we cannot know what went on inside the lizard king s heart or within the morrison household the morrisons who normally refrained from speaking with the press have said that they considered the statements regarding their deaths to be an attempt to shield them from the prying eyes of the media they understood the disturbing lyrics to have been inspired by events recounted in truman capote s book in cold blood whether morrison was actually trying to protect his family s privacy it was probably a great convenience for all concerned to keep the glare of publicity from them just as morrison s songs were climbing the charts his father had become the youngest admiral in the u s navy stationed in the pacific during the very contentious viet nam war it is doubtful that the admiral would have enjoyed being associated with the subversive genius of the doors or that the young rebel would have wanted to be linked to a military establishment that he had come to loathe perhaps some insight can be gained from a letter sent by the admiral in support of his son to the probation officer in charge of morrison s case following his florida conviction on obscenity charges in that letter the admiral spoke of the mutual affection his three children had for one another he also expressed pride in his son s amazing musical achievements and great concern and sorrow at his difficulties in florida he strongly defended his son s fundamental character then added i will always follow his progress with the greatest of interest and concern and stand ready to assist him in any way should he ask love and sex morrison a blatant philanderer never lacked the attentions of women including that of his long term companion courson a slim yet curvy red haired beauty courson met morrison well before he gained any fame or fortune and encouraged him to develop his poetry which was his true creative passion her support during those early days gave morrison confidence in the genuiness of her affections courson often used morrison s name with his apparent consent and morrison referred to courson s parents as the in laws it is said that courson was not happy with the demands that the doors placed upon morrison s time and talents claiming that they detracted from his more literary efforts be that as it may she certainly benefited from morrison s earnings which he seemed happy to lavish upon her he financed the opening of themis an upscale clothing boutique that she longed for when the boutique s expenses grew to astonishing proportions the doors accountant urged morrison to scale back his subsidies to courson morrison responded that he d rather spend money on courson than on accountants still their relationship was a stormy one with frequent loud arguments followed by tearful reunions danny sugerman surmised that part of their difficulties may have stemmed from a conflict between what they perceived to be their philosophical commitment to the ideal of an open relationship and the emotionally painful consequences of living in such a relationship since neither could admit that they couldn t bear the other s sexual infidelities their arguments burst out from what would seem to be trivialities whether morrison would have ever been capable of monogamy is another question entirely although morrison rented apartments for courson and would live with her on a regular basis he frequently stayed in hotels or slept at the doors office when he bought a bungalow in topanga canyon he acquired it in courson s name rather than his own it was long believed that the bungalow was the only residence that morrison acquired but in march two zero zero six his long time body guard tony funches told the press that morrison actually owned a home on kings road just above the sunset strip not far from the hyatt hotel funches added that morrison seldom stayed at the kings road house and bought it on the advice of his accountants as a tax write off courson met morrison early in his career and became known as his cosmic mate but she was not his first love in high school morrison had a girlfriend tandy martin who he would charm tease and with regularity infuriate while attending college in florida morrison met and fell in love with a gorgeous intelligent brunette mary werbelow when morrison transferred to ucla werbelow followed him to california werbelow was well liked by the other doors and morrison s friends but the relationship did not last after a small disagreement morrison turned to another young woman for comfort when werbelow discovered morrison at her rival s apartment naked she was so hurt that she broke up with morrison although they would speak from time to time they were never again a couple ray manzarek has said that morrison wrote the end as a memorial to this lost love in one nine seven zero morrison participated in a wiccan handfasting ceremony which fantasy writer patricia kennealy now insists was a wedding of some sort although such ceremonies are not recognized by law and according to kennealy s autobiography at the time the ceremony occurred both she and morrison recognized its non binding legal nature morrison however did not appear to take the ceremony seriously even on an emotional level and the relationship did not endure beyond a dozen or so encounters scattered across a year or two kennealy discussed her experiences with morrison in her autobiography and in an interview reported in the book rock wives morrison sampled the pleasures of his fans and groupies with regularity he also had numerous short flings with women who were celebrities in their own right including one with nico from velvet underground a one night stand with singer grace slick of the jefferson airplane and an alcohol fueled encounter with janis joplin that left joplin in tears judy huddleston also recalls her relationship with morrison in living and dying with jim morrison at the time of his death there were reportedly as many as two zero paternity actions pending against morrison morrison s sensual good looks and overt interest in carnality made him a sexual fantasy object of not just his female fans but quite a few male admirers he was often referred to by reviewers as having an androgynous appeal that went along with his polymorphic pansexual writings this wide ranging sexual appeal has caused some commentators to speculate that morrison may have been bi sexual or secretly gay but morrison s insatiable appetite for women would appear to speak for itself death jim morrison s grave at p re lachaise morrison moved to paris in march one nine seven one with the intention of taking a break from performing and concentrating on his writing hoping to get his life back on track morrison lost a great deal of weight and shaved off his beard he died soon thereafter on july three one nine seven one in his bathtub at the age of two seven many fans and biographers have speculated that the cause of death was a drug overdose but the official report listed heart failure although there was apparently

according to his account courson told him that morrison had indeed died of a heroin overdose when he inhaled copious amounts of the substance believing it to be cocaine courson herself died of a heroin overdose shortly after being declared morrison s common law wife by the california court in which his estate was undergoing probate proceedings like morrison she was two seven years old at the time of her death morrison is buried in the famous p re lachaise cemetery in eastern paris in the past some of his fans were nuisances leaving litter graffiti and cannabis behind to the point where the gravesite is surrounded by a fence well publicized complaints about desecration of surrounding grave sites by numerous families of the deceased led many to expect that morrison s remains would be forcibly relocated when the three zero year lease to his plot expired parisian authorities however have denied any such intention indeed morrison s grave has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in paris after the eiffel tower notre dame and the louvre in one nine nine three his parents visited the site and made arrangements with a cleaning company to have the graffiti removed from the nearby tombstones wgs eight four n four eight five one three three eight e zero two two three three seven two many fans have attempted to translate the greek inscription found on the headstone of morrison s grave as transliterated into english it reads kawa ton daimona eaytoy various interpretations have been proposed including down presumably in hell with his own demons burnt by his demons with the devil himself and other creative possibilities but in ancient greek the word daimon means spirit rather than demon and contains no negative or pejorative qualities the phrase is more properly translated as true to his own spirit and is the meaning intended by the morrison family when the inscription was selected it was morrison s father who either selected the phrase or drafted it himself the admiral being widely read in the ancient koine greek the original language of the new testament chose a phrase that fit both the philosophy and reality of his son s life as well as providing a fitting link to morrison s long abiding interest in ancient myth and symbology some conspiracy theorists contend that morrison did not die in paris the fact that only two people other than the police emergency personnel and mortician admitted to the press that they had seen his body has helped fuel the rumor for over thirty years throughout morrison s turbulent career there had been numerous rumors that he had been killed in an auto accident or had died of a drug overdose perhaps then it isn t so surprising that fans would doubt the reality of his passing jerry hopkins recounts in the lizard king that well before the doors achieved noticable success morrison had joked that he should fake his own death in order to generate publicity according to some of morrison s friends and band mates once the doors had achieved their remarkable success and publicity was no longer seen as being so desirable morrison spoke of wanting to fake his death and move to africa in order to escape the publicity that surrounded his every move he told them that if he could succeed with the ruse he would write to them using the pseudonym mr mojo risin such a disappearing act would have paralleled the life of one of morrison s favorite french poets arthur rimbaud according to robbie krieger and other doors members they have yet to receive any letters nonetheless some fans still feel his death was a hoax influence morrison remains one of the most popular and influential singers in rock history as the doors catalogue has become a staple of classic rock radio stations to this day he is widely regarded as the prototypical rock star surly sexy and mysterious the leather pants he was fond of wearing both onstage and off have since become stereotyped as rock star apparel morrison s performances have influenced many including patti smith ian curtis david gahan henry rollins ian astbury perry farrell scott weiland trent reznor eddie vedder scott stapp and marilyn manson the legendary punk prototypes iggy and the stooges are said to have formed after lead singer iggy pop was inspired by morrison while attending a doors concert in ann arbor michigan one of pop s best

of rimbaud s verse into english i don t read french easily he wrote your book travels around with me this was fowlie s introduction to jim morrison when he finally encountered the music of the doors he immediately recognized rimbaud s influence in the lyrics fowlie went on to give lectures on numerous campuses comparing the lives philosophies and poetry of morrison and rimbaud other colleges saw the obvious value of adding morrison to their coverage of symbolist and modern poetry classes and such courses flourished luring many students into a serious study of poetry jim morrison in fiction in the early one nine eight zero s low budget filmmaker larry buchanan made the film beyond the doors aka down on us which advanced the theory that morrison along with jimi hendrix and janis joplin were killed by the government in an attempt to stamp out radicals the story of morrison s life was filmed in one nine nine one by oliver stone in his biopic the doors starring val kilmer as morrison the film was critically well received but a commercial failure the surviving doors were reportedly not pleased with the historical liberties that stone took with their story fans believed it failed to show morrison s poetic side and only delved into his hedonistic self destructive lizard king persona kilmer was stone s second choice for the role the first being the cult lead singer ian astbury which astbury declined although it was also reported that kyle maclachlan who played manzarek had originally wanted to play the morrison role himself astbury went on to join the new incarnation of the

some sources say although it s unverified that while in france at the end of his life jim did the charleville pilgrimage the birthplace of rimbaud in the north of france in any event this lineage between the man with the soles of wind rimbaud s nickame and the lizard king jim s nickname is very fitting both symbolized the bravado and the rebellion of youth against a conservative society who seeks to quelch the individual through social control both were brilliant individuals torn between their ambition to shake things up through their art and their temptation to drift away before being caught up and finally struck down by their inner demons but most of all they were visionaries with a profound and mystical feeling that there is something more something beyond something that their poetry and music allowed us to touch if only for a brief moment if my poetry aims to achieve anything it s to deliver people from the limited ways in which they see and feel jim once said and that is exactly what he and the doors achieved with their hauntingly beautiful music that stays with you long after the music s over they take us to uncharted territories they let us break on through to the

l simon and paul ehrlich entered in a famous wager in one nine eight zero betting on a mutually agreed upon measure of resource scarcity over the decade leading up to one nine nine zero the wager simon had ehrlich choose five of several commodity metals ehrlich chose five metals copper chrome nickel tin and tungsten simon bet that their prices would go down ehrlich bet they would go up the face off occurred in the pages of social science quarterly where simon challenged ehrlich to put his money where his mouth was in response to ehrlich s published claim that if i were a gambler i would take even money that england will not exist in the year two zero zero zero a proposition simon regarded as too silly to bother with simon countered with a public offer to stake us one zero zero zero zero on my belief that the cost of non government controlled raw materials including grain and oil will not rise in the long run you could name your own terms select any raw material you wanted copper tin whatever and select any date in the future any date more than a year away and simon would bet that the commodity s price on that date would be lower than what it was at the time of the wager ehrlich and his colleagues picked five metals that they thought would undergo big price rises chromium copper nickel tin and tungsten then on paper they bought two zero zero worth of each for a total bet of one zero zero zero using the prices on september two nine one nine eight zero as an index they designated september two nine one nine nine zero one zero years hence as the payoff date if the inflation adjusted prices of the various metals rose in the interim simon would pay ehrlich the combined difference if the prices fell ehrlich et al would pay simon between one nine eight zero and one nine nine zero the world s population grew by more than eight zero zero million the largest increase in one decade in all of history but by september one nine nine zero without a single exception the price of each of ehrlich s selected metals had fallen and in some cases had dropped through the floor chrome which had sold for three nine zero a pound in one nine eight zero was down to three seven zero in one nine nine zero tin which was eight seven two a pound in one nine eight zero was down to three eight eight a decade later as a result in october one nine nine zero paul ehrlich mailed julian simon a check for five seven six zero seven to settle the wager in simon s favor analysis of why ehrlich lost according to paul ehrlich s website in one nine eight zero julian simon repeatedly challenged environmental scientists to bet against him on trends in prices of commodities asserting that humanity would never run out of anything paul and the other scientists knew that the five metals in the proposed wager were not critical indicators and said so at the time they emphasized that the depletion of so called renewable resources environmental resources such as soils forests species diversity and groundwater is much more indicative of the deteriorating state of society s life support systems nonetheless after consulting with many colleagues paul and berkeley physicists john harte and john holdren accepted simon s challenge in late one nine eight zero julian simon won because the price of three of the five metals went down in absolute terms and all five of the metals fell in price in inflation adjusted terms with both tin and tungsten falling by more than half inflation adjusted so per the terms of the wager ehrlich paid simon the difference in price between the same quantity of metals in one nine eight zero and one nine nine zero which was five seven six zero seven the prices of all five metals increased between one nine five zero and one nine seven five but ehrlich believes three of the five went down during the one nine eight zero s because of the price of oil doubling in one nine seven nine and because of a worldwide recession in the early one nine eight zero s yet it is significant that all of the former s ehrlich s grim predictions had been decisively overturned by events ehrlich was wrong about higher natural resource prices about famines of unbelievable proportions occurring by one nine seven five about hundreds of millions of people starving to death in the one nine seven zero s and eight zero s about the world entering a genuine age of scarcity in one nine nine zero for his having promoted greater public understanding of environmental problems ehrlich received a macarthur foundation genius award simon always found it somewhat peculiar that neither the science piece nor his public wager with ehrlich nor anything else that he did said or wrote seemed to make much of a dent on the world at large for some reason he could never comprehend people were inclined to believe the very worst about anything and everything they were immune to contrary evidence just as if they d been medically vaccinated against the force of fact furthermore there seemed to be a bizarre reverse cassandra effect operating in the universe whereas the mythical cassandra spoke the awful truth and was not believed these days experts spoke awful falsehoods and they were believed repeatedly being wrong actually seemed to be an advantage conferring some sort of puzzling magic glow upon the speaker simon offered to raise the wager to two zero zero zero zero and use any resources at any time that ehrlich preferred but the two were unable to reach an agreement on the terms of a second wager the proposed second wager understanding that simon wanted to bet again ehrlich and climatologist stephen schneider counter offered challenging simon to bet on one five current trends betting one zero zero zero that each will get worse as in the previous wager over a ten year future period the trends they bet would continue to worsen were the three years two zero zero two two zero zero four will on average be warmer than one nine nine two one nine nine four there will be more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in two zero zero four than in one nine nine four there will be more nitrous oxide in the atmosphere in two zero zero four than one nine nine four the concentration of ozone in the lower atmosphere the troposphere will be greater than in one nine nine four emissions of the air pollutant sulfur dioxide in asia will be significantly greater in two zero zero four than in one nine nine four there will be less fertile cropland per person in two zero zero four than in one nine nine four there will be less agricultural soil per person in two zero zero four than one nine nine four there will be on average less rice and wheat grown per person in two zero zero two two zero zero four than in one nine nine two one nine nine four in developing nations there will be less firewood available per person in two zero zero four than in one nine nine four the remaining area of virgin tropical moist forests will be significantly smaller in two zero zero four than in one nine nine four the oceanic fisheries harvest per person will continue its downward trend and thus in two zero zero four will be smaller than in one nine nine four there will be fewer plant and animal species still extant in two zero zero four than in one nine nine four more people will die of aids in two zero zero four than in one nine nine four between one nine nine four and two zero zero four sperm cell counts of human males will continue to decline and reproductive disorders will continue to increase the gap in wealth between the richest one zero of humanity and the poorest one zero will be greater in two zero zero four than in one nine nine four simon declined the bet and used the following analogy to explain why he did so let me characterize their ehrlich and schneider s offer as follows i predict and this is for real that the average performances in the next olympics will be better than those in the last olympics on average the performances have gotten better olympics to olympics for a variety of reasons what ehrlich and others says is that they don t want to bet on athletic performances they want to bet on the conditions of the track or the weather or the officials or any other such indirect measure external links wired magazine article on julian simon as doomslayer and the wager paul ehrlich s webpage on the two simon

using a hookah an illustration from alice in wonderland he drew many topical cartoons and caricatures for punch in the late one nine th century but is best remembered today for his illustrations for lewis carroll s alice in wonderland and through the looking glass tenniel s influence on modern illustration can be seen in the work of gothic artists like edward gorey mark ryden and dame darcy his most obvious american counterpart would be john r neill illustrator of frank baum s land of oz series he was born in london and educated himself for his career and although he became a probationer and then a student of the royal academy he soon left the schools where at that time there was little teaching in one eight three six he sent his first picture to the exhibition of the society of british artists and in one eight four five contributed a one six ft cartoon an allegory of justice to the competition held in that year of designs for the mural decoration of the new palace of westminster for this he received a two zero zero premium and a commission to paint a fresco in the upper waiting hall or hall of poets in the house of lords in spite of his tendency towards high art he was already known and appreciated as a humorist and his early companionship with charles keene fostered and developed his talent for scholarly caricature at christmas time one eight five zero he was invited by mark lemon to fill the position of joint cartoonist with john leech on punch from which richard doyle offended by the attitude adopted by the paper towards the papal see at the time of the so called aggression had suddenly resigned on the strength of his remarkable illustrations to aesop s fables in which artistic power humour of observation and knowledge of animal life were equally apparent tenniel was selected on douglas jerrold s initiative to fill the breach and he contributed his first drawing in the initial letter appearing on p two two four vol xix his first cartoon was lord jack the giant killer it showed lord john russell whose letter on the aggression had recently been published valiantly assailing with the sword of truth and liberty cardinal wiseman armed with a crozier in one eight five two we find tenniel s first superb lion and his first obituary cartoon gradually he took over altogether the weekly drawing of the political big cut which john leech was happy to resign into his hands in order to restrict himself to his pictures of life and character leech s work consisted for the most part of farce tenniel s was high comedy and not infrequently tragedy and the freedom of the humorist heightened the severer beauties of the satirist this illustration from through the looking glass accompanied the poem jabberwocky when leech died his friend continued his work alone and except in one eight six four one eight six eight and one eight seven five seven eight during short spells of illness or holiday he did not miss a single week about two three zero zero

banquet june one two at which mr aj balfour then leader of the house of commons presided and was supported by distinguished representatives of all that was best in english life on that occasion mr balfour s description of tenniel as a great artist and a great gentleman was applauded by the press of the whole country the nemesis of neglect one eight eight eight punch cartoon commenting on the jack the ripper murders the main quality of sir john tenniel s work is accuracy of drawing precision of touch grace and dignity of conception and so far as such things can be compatible geniality of satire tenniel raised the political cartoon into a classic composition from which a sense of nobility is rarely absent the beauty and statuesqueness of his ideal figures recall the influence perhaps of cornelius and overbeck that german manner which was characteristic of many of our finer draughtsmen upon wood at the middle of the one nine th century but tenniel s work is always original unforced and fresh and it never suggests what is the fact that the artists work is drawn exclusively from memory and never from the model it may be mentioned that tenniel s wonderful observation has been conducted and his knowledge accumulated literally through a single eye the other having been lost during a fencing bout in his youth it was in recognition not only of his ability as an artist in black and white but of his service in infusing good humour and good taste into one phase of political life that a knighthood was conferred upon him on mr gladstone s recommendation in one eight nine three without pronounced political opinions of his own sir john tenniel adopted in his work those of his paper of which the whig proclivities were to some degree softened by his pencil the political history not of england only but to some extent of the world of half a century appears in sir john tenniel s weekly cartoons which are dignified by a number of types invented by the artist the classic beauty of which may he looked for in vain in kindred work by any previous cartoonist take for example sir john s famous picture of dropping the pilot which appeared in punch on march two zero one eight nine

by the profound cultural contributions of african americans it is characterized by blue notes syncopation swing call and response polyrhythms and improvisation jazz has been described as america s classical music and started in saloons throughout the nation history roots of jazz jazz master louis armstrong remains one of the most loved and best known of all jazz musicians jazz has roots in the combination of western and african music traditions including spirituals blues and ragtime stemming ultimately from west africa western sahel and new england s religious hymns and hillbilly music as well as in european military band music after originating in african american communities near the beginning of the two zero th century jazz gained international popularity by the one nine two zero s since then jazz has had a pervasive influence on other musical styles worldwide even today various jazz styles continue to evolve the word jazz itself is rooted in american slang probably of sexual origin although various alternative derivations have been suggested according to university of southern california film professor todd boyd the term was originally slang for sexual intercourse as its earliest musicians found employment in new orleans brothel parlors with the word deriving from the term jass the term jass was rude sexual slang related either to the term jism or to the jasmine perfume popular among urban prostitutes lacking an attentive audience the musicians began to play for each other and their performances achieved esthetic complexity not evident in ragtime at the root of jazz is the blues the folk music of former enslaved africans in the u s south and their descendants heavily influenced by west african cultural and musical traditions that evolved as black musicians migrated to the cities according to pulitzer prize winning african american composer and classical and jazz trumpet virtuoso wynton marsalis jazz is something negroes invented and it said the most profound things not only about us and the way we look at things but about what modern democratic life is really about it is the nobility of the race put into sound jazz has all the elements from the spare and penetrating to the complex and enveloping it is the hardest music to play that i know of and it is the highest rendition of individual emotion in the history of western music needless to say the view of jazz as simply and solely black music is controversial numerous non black musicians bix beiderbecke benny goodman harry james zoot sims gerry mulligan bill evans stan getz dave brubeck and charlie haden among others have made important contributions to jazz in addition it could be argued that jazz would not exist without both instruments invented or developed by europeans the trumpet saxophone trombone double bass etc and the previous work of europeans in music theory which was explored in different ways by jazz musicians such as increased use of the seventh chord and extended chords the origins of jazz are multicultural not entirely pure and perhaps reflect the hybrid nature of american culture more than any other art form early jazz influences found their first mainstream expression in the marching band and dance band music of the day which was the standard form of popular concert music at the turn of century the instruments of these groups became the basic instruments of jazz brass reeds and drums and are voiced in the western one two tone scale black musicians frequently used the melody structure and beat of marches as points of departure but says north by south from charleston to harlem a project of the national endowment for the humanities a black musical spirit involving rhythm and melody was bursting out of the confines of european musical tradition even though the performers were using european styled instruments this african american feel for rephrasing melodies and reshaping rhythm created the embryo from which many great black jazz musicians were to emerge many black musicians also made a living playing in small bands hired to lead funeral processions in the new orleans african american tradition these africanized bands played a seminal role in the articulation and dissemination of early jazz traveling throughout black communities in the deep south and to northern big cities these musician pioneers were the hand helping to fashion the music s howling raucous then free wheeling raggedy ragtime spirit quickening it to a more eloquent sophisticated swing incarnation for all its genius early jazz with its humble folk roots was the product of primarily self taught musicians but an impressive postbellum network of black established and operated institutions schools and civic societies in both the north and the south plus widening mainstream opportunities for education produced ever increasing numbers of young formally trained african american musicians some of them schooled in classical european musical forms lorenzo tio and scott joplin were among this new wave of musically literate jazz artists joplin the son of a former slave and a free born woman of color was largely self taught until age one one when he received lessons in the fundamentals of music theory from a classically trained german immigrant in texarkana texas also contributing to this trend was a tightening of jim crow laws in louisiana in the one eight nine zero s which caused the expulsion from integrated bands of numbers of talented formally trained african american musicians the ability of these musically literate black jazzmen to transpose and then read what was in great part an improvisational art form became an invaluable element in the preservation and dissemination of musical innovations that took on added importance in the approaching big band era the united states music scene at the start of the two zero th century by the turn of the century american society had begun to shed the heavy handed straitlaced formality that had characterized the victorian era strong influence of african american music traditions had already been a part of mainstream popular music in the united states for generations going back to the one nine th century minstrel show tunes and the melodies of stephen foster public dance halls clubs and tea rooms opened in the cities curiously named black dances inspired by african dance moves like the shimmy turkey trot buzzard lope chicken scratch monkey glide and the bunny hug eventually were adopted by a white public the cake walk developed by slaves as a send up of their masters formal dress balls became the rage white audiences saw these dances first in vaudeville shows then performed by exhibition dancers in the clubs the popular dance music of the time was not jazz but there were precursor forms along the blues ragtime continuum of musical experimentation and innovation that soon would blossom into jazz popular tin pan alley composers like irving berlin incorporated ragtime influence into their compositions though they seldom used the specific musical devices that were second nature to jazz players the rhythms the blue notes few things did more to popularize the idea of hot music than berlin s hit song of one nine one one alexander s ragtime band which became a craze as far from home as vienna although the song wasn t written in rag time the lyrics describe a jazz band right up to jazzing up popular songs as in the line if you want to hear the swanee river played in ragtime the early new orleans jass style a number of regional styles contributed to the early development of jazz arguably the single most important was that of the new orleans louisiana area which was the first to be commonly given the name jazz early on often spelled jass the city of new orleans and the surrounding area had long been a regional music center people from many different nations of africa europe and latin america contributed to new orleans rich musical heritage in the french and spanish colonial era slaves had more freedom of cultural expression than in the english colonies of what would become the united states in the protestant colonies african music was looked on as inherently pagan and was commonly suppressed while in louisiana it was allowed african musical celebrations held at least as late as the one eight three zero s in new orleans congo square were attended by interested whites as well and some of their melodies and rhythms found their way into the compositions of white creole composer louis moreau gottschalk in addition to the slave population new orleans also had north america s largest community of free people of color some of whom prided themselves on their education and used european instruments to play both european music and their own folk tunes according to many new orleans musicians who remembered the era the key figures in the development of the new style were flamboyant trumpeter buddy bolden and the members of his band bolden is remembered as the first to take the blues hitherto a folk music sung and self accompanied on string instruments or blues harp harmonica and arrange it for brass instruments bolden s band played blues and other tunes constantly variating the melody improvising for both dance and brass band settings creating a sensation in the city and quickly being imitated by many other musicians by the early years of the two zero th century travelers visiting new orleans remarked on the local bands ability to play ragtime with a pep not heard elsewhere characteristics which set the early new orleans style apart from the ragtime music played elsewhere included freer rhythmic improvisation ragtime musicians elsewhere would rag a tune by giving a syncopated rhythm and playing a note twice at half the time value while the new orleans style used more intricate rhythmic improvisation often placing notes far from the implied beat compare for example the piano rolls of jelly roll morton with those of scott joplin the new orleans style players also adopted much of the vocabulary of the blues including bent and blue notes and instrumental growls and smears otherwise not used on european instruments key figures in the early development of the new style were freddie keppard a dark creole of color who mastered bolden s style joe oliver whose style was even more deeply soaked in the blues than bolden s and kid ory a trombonist who helped crystallize the style with his band hiring many of the city s best musicians the new style also spoke to young whites as well especially the working class children of immigrants who took up the style with enthusiasm papa jack laine led a multi ethnic band through which passed almost all of two generations of early new orleans white jazz musicians and a number of non whites as well other regional styles meanwhile other regional styles were developing which would influence the development of jazz african american minister rev daniel j jenkins of charleston south carolina was an unlikely figure of far reaching importance in the early development of jazz in one eight nine one jenkins established the jenkins orphanage for boys and four years later instituted a rigorous music program in which the orphanage s young charges were taught the religious and secular music of the day including overtures and marches precocious orphans and defiant runaways some of whom had played ragtime in bars and brothels were delivered to the orphanage for salvation and rehabilitation and made their musical contributions as well in the fashion of the fisk jubilee singers and fisk university the jenkins orphanage bands traveled widely earning money to keep the orphanage afloat it was an expensive enterprise jenkins typically took in approximately one two five one five zero black lambs yearly and many of them received formal musical training less than three zero years later five bands operated nationally with one traveling to england again in the fisk tradition it would be hard to overstate the influence of the jenkins orphanage bands on early jazz scores of whose members went on to play with jazz legends like duke ellington lionel hampton and count basie among them were the likes of trumpet virtuosos cat anderson gus aitken and jabbo smith in the northeastern united states a hot style of playing ragtime developed while centered in new york city it could be found in african american communities from baltimore to boston some later commentators have categorized it after the fact as an early form of jazz while others disagree it was characterized by rollicking rhythms but lacked the distinctly bluesy influence of the southern styles the solo piano version of the northeast style was typified by such players as noted composer eubie blake the son of slaves whose musical career spanned an impressive eight decades james p johnson took the northeast style and around one nine one nine developed a style of playing that came to be known as stride in stride piano the right hand plays the melody while the active left hand walks or strides from upbeat to downbeat maintaining the rhythm johnson influenced later pianists like fats waller and willie smith the top orchestral leader of the style was james reese europe and his one nine one three and one nine one four recordings preserve a rare glimpse of this style at its peak it was during this time that europe s music profoundly influenced a young george gershwin who would go on to compose the jazz inspired classic rhapsody in blue by the time europe recorded again in one nine one nine he was in the process of incorporating the influence of the new orleans style into his playing the recordings of tim brymn give later generations another look at the northeastern hot style with little of the new orleans influence yet evident in chicago at the start of the one nine one zero s a popular type of dance band consisted of a saxophone vigorously ragging a melody over a four square rhythm section the city soon fell heavily under the influence of waves of new orleans musicians and the older style blended with the new orleans style to form what would be called chicago jazz starting in the late one nine one zero s along the banks of the mississippi around memphis tennessee to saint louis missouri another band style developed incorporating the blues the most famous composer and bandleader of the style was the father of the blues w c handy while in some ways similar to the new orleans style bolden s influence may have spread upriver it lacked the freewheeling improvisation found further south handy indeed for many years denounced jazz as needlessly chaotic and in his style improvisation was limited to short fills between phrases and considered inappropriate for the main melody the national spread of jass music a number of educated colored new orleanians left the south due to increasingly restrictive jim crow laws at first heading mostly to california one of these was musician bill johnson who thought a good new orleans style band would have commercial possibilities out west johnson sent for some of the city s best hot musicians including freddie keppard to join him at the start of the one nine one zero s forming the original creole orchestra a vaudeville promoter caught the band playing to enthusiastic crowds in between rounds at a boxing match and booked the band to tour the nation on the pantages circuit the members of the creole orchestra wrote their colleagues back home that hot new orleans musicians could make much better money playing their style up north and out west than they could at home encouraging many to start spreading the style around the nation chicago was one of the first cities to embrace the new style and from some accounts it was here that the new orleans style was first popularly christened jass back in new orleans it was called by such names as ratty music hot music or simply ragtime sidney bechet often continued to call his music ragtime as late as the one nine five zero s the style was so different from the ragtime and dance music of the rest of the nation that a new name was needed to distinguish it apparently the first band billed as playing jass was that of trombonist tom brown the term jass was rude sexual slang related either to the term jism or to the jasmine perfume popular among urban prostitutes of whom a certain billie holiday was reported to be subjected to earlier before her great career in jass that ensued in the following decades one group that followed the original creoles and tom brown to chicago went north in one nine one six as stein s dixie jass band these veterans of the papa jack laine bands made their way to new york city the following year calling themselves the original dixieland jass band in new york they had an opportunity to record phonograph records the discs recorded as a novelty were a surprise national hit and jass quickly became a national craze it was in new york where jass became jazz in the late one nine one zero s purportedly because mischievous people were making a habit of scratching out the j s on posters which then unfortunately advertised ass band s jazz in the one nine two zero s the king and thomas edison s invention in one eight seven seven of the phonograph record made quality music accessible to virtually everyone pullman s ingenious rolling sleeping quarters provided employment to legions of african american men who criss crossed the nation as sleeping car porters and by the second decade of the twentieth century the pullman company employed more african americans than any single business concern in the united states but pullman porters were more than solicitous smiling faces in smart navy blue uniforms the most dapper and sophisticated of them were culture bearers spreading the card game of bid whist the latest dance crazes regional news and a heightened sense of black pride to cities and towns wherever the railways reached many porters also shared traded and even sold race records to augment their income speeding artistic innovations to musicians eager to hear the latest spreading among the general public an awareness of and appreciation for this rapidly evolving musical form and in the process putting jazz on the fast track to first u s then worldwide acclaim with prohibition the constitutional amendment that forbade the sale of alcoholic beverages the legal saloons and cabarets were closed but in their place hundreds of speakeasies appeared where patrons drank and musicians entertained the presence of dance venues and the subsequent increased demand for accomplished musicians meant more artists were able to support themselves by playing professionally as a result the numbers of professional musicians increased and jazz like all the popular music of the one nine two zero s adopted the four four beat of dance music another nineteenth century invention radio came into its own in the one nine two zero s after the first commercial radio station in the u s began broadcasting in pittsburgh in one nine two two radio stations proliferated at a remarkable rate and with them the popularity of jazz jazz became associated with things modern sophisticated and decadent the third decade of the new century a time of technological marvels flappers flashy automobiles organized crime bootleg whiskey and bathtub gin would come to be known as the jazz age key figures of the decade this usps stamp celebrates the rise of jazz in the one nine two zero s king oliver was jazz king of chicago in the early one nine two zero s when chicago was the national hub of jazz his band was the epitome of the new orleans hot ensemble jazz style unfortunately his band s recordings were little heard outside of chicago and new orleans but the ensemble was a powerful influence on younger musicians both black and white sidney bechet was the first master jazz musician to take up what previously often had been dismissed as a novelty instrument the saxophone bechet helped propel jazz in more individualistic personality and solo driven directions in this last point bechet was joined by a young protege of king oliver louis armstrong who was to become one of the major forces in the development of jazz armstrong was an extraordinary improviser capable of creating endless variations on a single melody armstrong also popularized scat singing an improvisational vocal technique in which nonsensical syllables or words are sung or otherwise vocalized often as part of a call and response interaction with other musicians onstage his unique gravely voice and innate sense of swing made scat an instant hit arguably bix beiderbecke was both the first white and the first non new orleanian to make major original contributions to the development of jazz with his legato phrasing bringing the influence of classical romanticism to jazz paul whiteman was the most commercially successful bandleader of the one nine two zero s billing himself as the king of jazz sacrificing spontaneous improvisation for the sake of elaborate written arrangements whiteman claimed to be making a lady out of jazz despite his hiring bix and many of the other best white jazz musicians of the era later generations of jazz lovers have often judged whiteman s music to have little to do with real jazz nonetheless his notion of combining jazz with elaborate orchestrations has been returned to repeatedly by composers and arrangers of later decades it was whiteman who commissioned gershwin s rhapsody in blue which was debuted by whiteman s orchestra fletcher henderson led the top african american band in new york city at first he wished to follow the lead of paul whiteman but after hiring louis armstrong to play in his band henderson realized the importance of the improvising soloist in developing jazz bands henderson s arrangements would play a significant role in the development of the big band era in the following decade young pianist and bandleader duke ellington first came to national attention in the late one nine two zero s with his tight band making many recordings and radio broadcasts ellington s importance would grow in the coming decades today he is widely regarded as one of the most important composers in jazz history one nine three zero s to one nine five zero s while the solo became more important in jazz popular bands became larger in size the big band became the popular provider of music for the era big bands varied in their jazz content some such as benny goodman s orchestra were highly jazz oriented while others such as glenn miller s left little space for improvisation most were somewhere in between having some musicians adept at jazz solos playing with section men who kept the rhythm and arrangements going however even bands without jazz soloists adopted a sound owing much to the jazz vocabularity for example sax sections playing what sounded like an improvised variation on a melody and may have originated as a transcription of one key figures in developing the big jazz band were arrangers and bandleaders fletcher henderson don redman and the man sometimes deemed the most prolific composer in american history duke ellington in the early one nine two zero s popular music was still a mixture of things current dance numbers novelty songs show tunes businessman s bounce music as one horn player put it but musicians with steady jobs playing with the same companions were able to go far beyond that the ellington band at the cotton club and the various kansas city groups that became the count basie band date from this period over time social strictures regarding racial segregation began to relax in entertainment white bandleaders who tended to mold the music more to orthodox rhythms and harmony began to recruit black musicians in the mid one nine three zero s benny goodman hired pianist teddy wilson vibraharpist lionel hampton and guitarist charlie christian to join small groups during this period the popularity of swing genre and big band music was at its height making stars of such men as glenn miller and duke ellington swing the popular music of its time covered a broad spectrum from sweet to hot bands with the jazz content varying across the range the influence of louis armstrong also continued to grow musicians and bandleaders like cab calloway and later trumpeter dizzy gillespie and pop vocalists like bing crosby embraced armstrong s style of improvising on the melody and u s pop singers seldom since have rendered a tune straight in the pre jazz style in crosby s mould artists famed for their vocals rather than instrumental skills also began to emerge as great jazz singers in the form of vocalists like ella fitzgerald billie holliday and later frank sinatra and sarah vaughan all of whom jumped on the scat bandwagon that galvanised the genre till the one nine five zero s a development of swing in the early one nine four zero s known as jumping the blues or jump music anticipated rhythm and blues and rock and roll in some respects it involved the use of small combos instead of big bands and a concentration on up tempo music using the familiar blues chord progressions drawing largely upon the evolution of boogie woogie in the one nine three zero s it used a doubled rhythm that is the rhythm section played eight to the bar eight beats per measure instead of four big joe turner a kansas city singer who worked in the one nine three zero s with swing bands like count basie s became a boogie woogie star in the one nine four zero s and then in the one nine five zero s was one of the first innovators of rock and roll notably with his song shake rattle and roll another jazz founder of rock and roll was saxophonist louis jordan development of bebop the next major stylistic turn came in the one nine four zero s with bebop led by such distinctive stylists as the saxophonist charlie parker known as yardbird or bird bud powell and dizzy gillespie this marked a major shift of jazz from pop music for dancing to a high art less accessible cerebral musician s music thelonious monk while too individual to be strictly a bebop musician was also associated with this movement bop musicians valued complex improvisations based on chord progressions rather than melody hard bop moved away from cool jazz incorporating influences from soul music gospel music and the blues hard bop was at the peak of its popularity in the one nine five zero s and one nine six zero s and was associated with such figures as sonny rollins john coltrane miles davis art blakey and charles mingus later bebop and hard bop musicians such as trumpeter miles davis made more stylistic advances with modal jazz where the harmonic structure of pieces was much more free than previously and was frequently only implied by skeletal piano chords and bass parts the instrumentalists then would improvise around a given mode of the scale latin jazz main article latin jazz latin jazz has two varieties afro cuban and brazilian afro cuban jazz was played in the u s directly after the bebop period while brazilian jazz became more popular in the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s afro cuban jazz began as a movement after the death of charlie parker notable bebop musicians such as dizzy gillespie and billy taylor started afro cuban bands at that time gillespie s work was mostly with big bands of this genre while the music was influenced by such cuban and puerto rican musicians as tito puente and much later arturo sandoval there were many americans who were drawing upon cuban rhythms for their work brazilian jazz is in north america at least nearly synonymous with bossa nova a brazilian popular style which is derived from samba with influences from jazz as well as other two zero th century classical and popular music bossa is generally slow played around eight zero beats per minute or so the music uses straight eighths rather than swing eighths and also uses difficult polyrhythms the best known bossa nova compositions are considered to be jazz standards in their own right the related term jazz samba essentially describes an adaptation of bossa nova compositions to the jazz idiom by american performers such as stan getz and charlie byrd and usually played at one two zero beats per minute or faster samba itself is actually not jazz but being derived from older afro brazilian music it shares some common characteristics free jazz main article free jazz free jazz or avant garde jazz is a subgenre that while rooted in bebop typically uses less compositional material and allows performers more latitude in what they choose to play free jazz s greatest departure from other styles is in the use of harmony and a regular swinging tempo both are often implied utilized loosely or abandoned altogether these approaches were rather controversial when first advanced but have generally found acceptance though sometimes grudgingly and have been utilized in part by other jazz performers there were earlier precedents but free jazz crystalized in the late one nine five zero s especially via ornette coleman and cecil taylor and probably found its greatest exposure in the late one nine six zero s with john coltrane archie shepp albert ayler sun ra pharoah sanders sam rivers leroy jenkins don pullen and others while perhaps less popular than other styles free jazz has exerted an influence to the present peter br tzmann ken vandermark william parker derek bailey and evan parker are leading contemporary free jazz musicians and musicians such as coleman taylor and sanders continue to play in this style keith jarrett has been prominent in defending free jazz from criticism by traditionalists in recent years jazz and rock music jazz fusion main article jazz fusion bitches brew is often cited as the most influential record in the history of jazz fusion with the growth of rock and roll in the one nine six zero s came the hybrid form jazz rock fusion again involving miles davis who recorded the fusion albums in a silent way and bitches brew in one nine six eight and one nine six nine respectively jazz was by this time no longer center stage in popular music but was still breaking new ground and combining and recombining in different forms notable artists of the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s jazz and fusion scene include chick corea herbie hancock and his headhunters band john mclaughlin and the mahavishnu orchestra al di meola jean luc ponty sun ra soft machine narada michael walden who would later enjoy huge success as a music producer wayne shorter jaco pastorius the pat metheny group and weather report some of these have continued to develop the genre into the two zero zero zero s recent developments the stylistic diversity of jazz has shown no sign of diminishing absorbing influences from such disparate sources as world music and avant garde classical music including african rhythm and traditional structure serialism and the extensive use of chromatic scale by such musicians as ornette coleman and john zorn beginning in the one nine seven zero s with such artists as keith jarrett paul bley billy childs the pat metheny group jan garbarek ralph towner and eberhard weber the ecm record label established a new chamber music aesthetic featuring mainly acoustic instruments and incorporating elements of world music and folk music this is sometimes referred to as european or nordic jazz despite some of the leading players being american however the jazz community has shrunk dramatically and split with a mainly older audience retaining an interest in traditional and straight ahead jazz styles a small core of practitioners and fans interested in highly experimental modern jazz and a constantly changing group of musicians fusing jazz idioms with contemporary popular music genres the latter have formed such styles as acid jazz which contains elements of one nine seven zero s disco acid swing which combines one nine four zero s style big band sounds with faster more aggressive rock influenced drums and electric guitar and nu jazz which combines elements of jazz and modern forms of electronic dance music exponents of the acid jazz style which was initially uk based included the brand new heavies james taylor quartet young disciples and corduroy in the united states acid jazz groups included the groove collective soulive and solsonics in a more pop or smooth jazz context jazz enjoyed a resurgence in the one nine eight zero s with such bands as pigbag and curiosity killed the cat achieving chart hits in britain sade adu became the definitive voice of smooth jazz there have been other developments in the one nine eight zero s and one nine nine zero s that were less commercially oriented many of these artists notably wynton marsalis called what they were doing jazz and in fact strove to define what the term actually meant they sought to create within what they felt was the tradition creating extensions of small and large forms initially pioneered by such artists as louis armstrong and duke ellington in the case of marsalis these efforts met with critical acclaim others musicians in this time period although clearly within the tradition of the great spontaneous composers such as charlie parker john coltrane fats navarro and many others choose to distance themselves from the term jazz and simply define what they were doing as music this in fact was suggested by the great composer duke ellington when the term jazz first began to be popular alternatively they created their own names for what they were doing such as m base many of these artists agree with the creative guitarist jean paul bourelly who feels that you shouldn t categorize according to styles of music you should categorize in terms of creative levels these musicians feel that rhythm is the key for further progress in the music bourelly similar to m base believes that the rhythmic innovations of james brown and other funk pioneers can provide an effective rhythmic base for spontaneous composition however the ideas of these musicians go far beyond simply playing over a funk groove extending the rhythmic ideas in a way analogous to what had been done with harmony in previous times some of the musicians involved in the approach called m base even view this as rhythmic harmony others like wynton marsalis disagree with this point of view preferring instead to retain the rhythmic base of swing for creating their music however all of these artists participate in spontaneous composition and only differ in creative focus and what could be called groove emphasis with the rise in popularity of various forms of electronic music during the late one nine eight zero s and one nine nine zero s some jazz artists have attempted a fusion of jazz with more of the experimental leanings of electronica particularly idm and drum and bass with various degrees of success this has been variously dubbed future jazz jazz house or nu jazz the more experimental and improvisional end of the spectrum includes scandinavia based artists such as pianist bugge wesseltoft trumpeter nils petter molv r who both began their careers on the ecm record label and the trio wibutee all of whom have gained their chops as instrumentalists in their own right in more traditional jazz circles the cinematic orchestra from the uk or julien lourau from france have also gained praise in this area toward the more pop or pure dance music end of the spectrum of nu jazz are such proponents as st germain and jazzanova who incorporate some live jazz playing with more metronomic house beats in the two zero zero zero s jazz hit the pop charts and blended with contemporary urban music through the work of artists like norah jones jill scott jamie cullum erykah badu amy winehouse and diana krall and the jazz advocacy of performers who are also music educators such as jools holland courtney pine and peter cincotti some of these new styles may be light on improvisation a key characteristic of jazz however their instrumentation and rhythms are similar to other jazz music and the label has stuck improvisation reggie workman pharoah sanders and idris muhammad c one nine seven eight jazz is often difficult to define but improvisation is unquestionably a key element of the form improvisation has been since early times an essential element in african and african american music and is closely related to the pervasiveness of call and response in west african and african american cultural expression the exact form of improvisation has changed over time early folk blues music often was based around a call and response pattern and improvisation would factor into the lyrics the melody or both part of the dixieland style involves musicians taking turns playing the melody while the others make up counter lines to go with it by the swing era big bands played carefully arranged sheet music but the music often would call for one member of the band to stand up and play a short improvised solo in bebop however the focus shifted from the cleverness of arrangement to the cleverness of improvisation over the form musicians gave comparably little attention to the composed melody or head which was played at the beginning and the end of the performance as previously noted later styles of jazz such as modal jazz abandoned the strict notion of a chord progression allowing the individual musicians to improvise more freely within the context of a given scale or mode the best known example of this is the classic miles davis album kind of blue when a pianist or guitarist improvises an accompaniment while a soloist is playing it is called comping or

the english language although he is also well known for his poetry and essays he also used the name isaac bickerstaff among other pseudonyms biography swift as depicted on a ir one zero series b banknote of the central bank of ireland jonathan swift was born at no seven hoey s court dublin to an english mother seven months after his father died he was educated by his uncle godwin and then sent to swift s heath kilkenny from where at the age of six years he went to the kilkenny grammar school also attended by the philosopher george berkeley in one six eight two he attended trinity college dublin and he moved to live with his mother abigail erick at leicester soon afterwards an opening to work for sir william temple presented itself in one six eight nine swift went to live at moor park surrey where he read to temple wrote for him and kept his accounts growing into confidence with his employer he was often trusted with matters of great importance within three years of their acquaintance temple had introduced his secretary to william iii and sent him to london to urge the king to consent to a bill for triennial parliaments when swift took up his residence at moor park he found there an eight year old girl she was the daughter of a merchant named edward johnson who had died young swift says that esther johnson was born on march one eight one six eight one she was later known as stella and would later feature largely in swift s life by one six nine four swift had grown tired of his position and finding that temple who valued his services was slow in finding him preferment he left moor park in order to carry out his resolve to go into the church he was ordained and obtained the prebend of kilroot near belfast in may one six nine six temple induced swift to return to moor park where he was employed in preparing temple s memoirs and correspondence for publication during this time swift wrote the battle of the books which was however not published until one seven zero four on his return to temple s house swift found his old playmate grown from a sickly child into a girl of fifteen in perfect health in the summer of one six nine nine temple died swift was offered and accepted the post of secretary and chaplain to the earl of berkeley one of the lords justices but when he reached ireland he found that the secretaryship had been given to another he soon however obtained the living of laracor agher and rathbeggan and the prebend of dunlavin in st patrick s cathedral dublin at laracor a mile or two from trim and twenty miles from dublin swift

him and soon afterwards published anonymously a political pamphlet a discourse on the contests and dissentions in athens and rome when he returned to ireland in september he was accompanied by stella now twenty years old and her friend mrs dingley there s a great deal of mystery and controversy over swift s relationship with stella many hold that they were secretly married in one seven one six although there has never been definite proof of this there is no doubt that she was dearer to him than anyone else and that his feelings for her did not change throughout his life swift was politically active between one seven zero seven and one seven one zero from february one seven zero eight to april one seven zero nine swift was in london successfully urging upon the godolphin administration the claims of the irish clergy to the first fruits and twentieths queen anne s bounty which brought in about two five zero zero a year already granted to their brethren in england his having been selected for such a commission shows that he was not yet regarded as a deserter from the whigs although the ill success of his representations probably helped to make him one as a result he became more and more intimate with the tory leaders and increasingly cool towards his older acquaintances swift received the reward of his services to the government the deanery of st patrick s dublin in april one seven one three swift was back again in the political strife in london in september taking oxford s part in the quarrel between that statesman and bolingbroke on the fall of the tories at the death of queen anne he saw that all was over and retired to ireland not to return again for twelve years in one seven one three he co founded the scriblerus club in one seven two three swift became engrossed in the irish agitation which led to the publication of the drapier s letters and in one seven two six he paid a long deferred visit to london taking with him the manuscript of gulliver s travels on january two eight one seven two eight stella died swift could not bear to be present but on the night of her death he began to write his very interesting character of mrs johnson he was too ill to be present at the funeral at st patrick s but afterwards a lock of her hair was found in his desk wrapped in a paper bearing the words only a woman s hair swift continued to produce pamphlets that reflected a growing misanthropy epitomized by a modest proposal one seven two nine in which he suggested the irish unburden themselves of their numerous children and break the cycle of poverty in the process by selling them to the rich as food it should be noted however that this was not an actual proposal but a satire of those who viewed people as simple statistics despite his irony however he showed many kindnesses to people who needed help he seems to have given mrs dingley fifty guineas a year pretending that it came from a fund for which he was trustee the title page to

zero n s was a german composer and organist whose sacred and secular works for choir orchestra and solo instruments drew together almost all of the strands of the baroque style and brought it to its ultimate maturity although he introduced no new musical forms he enriched the prevailing german style with a robust and dazzling contrapuntal technique a seemingly effortless control of harmonic and motivic organisation from the smallest to the largest scales and the adaptation of rhythms and textures from abroad particularly italy and france bach s forceful suavity and vast output have earned him wide acknowledgment as one of the greatest composers in the western tonal tradition revered for their intellectual depth technical command and artistic beauty his works include the brandenburg concertos the keyboard suites and partitas the mass in b minor the st matthew passion the musical offering the art of fugue and a large number of cantatas of which about two two zero survive an example of some of these stylistic traits appears below in the chorus ehre sei gott in der h he from the christmas oratorio written in one seven three four during his mature period biography early years johann sebastian bach was a member of one of the most extraordinary musical families of all time for more than two zero zero years the bach family had produced dozens of worthy performers and composers during a period in which the church local government and the aristocracy provided significant support for professional music making in the german speaking world particularly in the eastern electorates of thuringia and saxony sebastian s father johann ambrosius bach was a talented violinist and trumpeter in eisenach a town of some six zero zero zero residents in thuringia germany the post involved the organisation of secular music and participation in church music sebastian s uncles were all professional musicians ranging from church organists and court chamber musicians to composers contemporary documents indicate that just the name bach had come to be used as a synonym for musician places in which bach resided throughout his life his mother died in one six nine four and his father the following year the one zero year old orphan moved in with his eldest brother johann christoph bach the organist at ohrdruf a nearby town there he copied studied and performed music and apparently received valuable tuition from his brother this exposed him to the work of the great south german composers of the day such as pachelbel and froberger and possibly the music of north germans and of the french composers such as lully louis marchand and marin marais the boy probably witnessed and assisted the maintenance of the organ a precursor to his lifelong professional activity as a consultant in the building and restoration of organs bach s obituary indicates that sebastian would copy music out of his brother s scores but because scores were valuable and private commodities at the time johann christoph forbade johann to do so at the age of one four sebastian was awarded a choral scholarship with his older school friend georg erdmann to study at the prestigious st michael s school in l neburg not far from hamburg the largest city in germany this involved a long journey with his friend probably partly on foot and partly by coach his two years there appear to have been critical in exposing him to a wider palette of european culture than he would have experienced in thuringia in addition to singing in the a cappella choir it is likely that he played the school s three manual organ and harpsichords he probably learned french and italian and received a thorough grounding in theology latin history geography and physics he would have come into contact with sons of noblemen from northern germany sent to the highly selective school to prepare for careers in diplomacy government and the military it is likely that he had significant contact with organists in l neburg in particular georg b hm and visited several of those in hamburg such as reincken and bruhns through these musicians he probably gained access to the largest instruments he had played it is also likely that he became acquainted with the music of the north german tradition especially the work of dieterich buxtehude with music manuscripts from further afield and with treatises on music theory that were in the possession of these men arnstadt and m lhausen one seven zero three zero eight bach as a young manin january one seven zero three shortly after graduating bach took up a post as a court musician in the chapel of duke johann ernst in weimar a large town in thuringia his role there is unclear but appears to have included menial non musical duties during his seven month tenure at weimar his reputation as a keyboardist spread he was invited to inspect and give the inaugural recital on the new organ at st boniface s church in arnstadt the bach family had close connections with this oldest town in thuringia about one eight zero km to the southwest of weimar at the edge of the great forest in august one seven zero three he accepted the post of organist at that church with light duties a relatively generous salary and a new organ free of technical defects and tuned to a modern system that allowed a wide range of keys to be used it was around the time of his arnstadt appointment that bach was embarking on the serious composition of organ preludes among them the famous toccata and fugue in d minor these works in the north german tradition of virtuosic improvisatory preludes already show remarkably tight motivic control where a single short music idea is explored cogently throughout a movement however in these works the composer was still grappling with issues of large scale structure and had yet to fully develop his powers of contrapuntal writing where two or more melodies interact simultaneously strong family connections and a musically enthusiastic employer failed to prevent tension between the headstrong precocious young organist and the authorities after several years in the post he was apparently dissatisfied with the standard of singers in the choir more seriously there was his unauthorised absence from arnstadt for several months in one seven zero five zero six when he visited the great master buxtehude in the northern city of l beck this well known incident in bach s life involved his walking some four zero zero km each way to spend time with the man he probably regarded as the father figure of german organists the trip reinforced buxtehude s style as a foundation for bach s earlier works and the fact that he overstayed his planned visit by several months suggests that his time with the old man was immensely valuable to his art despite his comfortable position in arnstadt by one seven zero six bach appears to have realised that he needed to escape from the family milieu and move on to further his career he was then offered a more lucrative post as organist at st blasius in m hlhausen a large and important city to the north the following year he took up this senior post with significantly improved pay and conditions including a good choir four months after arriving at m hlhausen he married his second cousin from arnstadt maria barbara they had seven children four of whom survived to adulthood three of them wilhelm friedemann bach johann christian bach and carl philipp emanuel bach became important composers in the ornate rococo style that followed the baroque the church and city government at m hlhausen must have been proud of their new musical director they readily agreed to his plan for an expensive renovation of the organ at st blasius s and were so delighted at the elaborate festive cantata he wrote for the inauguration of the new council in one seven zero eight god is my king bwv seven one which is clearly in the style of buxtehude that they paid handsomely for its publication and twice in later years had the composer return to conduct it weimar one seven zero eight one seven after barely a year at m hlhausen bach left to take up a position as court organist and concert master at the ducal court in weimar a far cry from his earlier position there as lackey the munificent salary on offer at the court and the prospect of working entirely with a large well funded contingent of professional musicians may have prompted the move the family moved into an apartment just five minutes walk from the ducal palace in the following year their first child was born and they were joined by maria barbara s elder unmarried sister who remained with them to assist in the running of the household until her death in one seven two nine it was in weimar that two musically significant sons were born wf and cpe bach bach s position in weimar marked the start of a sustained period of composing keyboard and orchestral works in which he had attained the technical proficiency and confidence to extend the prevailing large scale structures and to synthesize influences from abroad from the music of italians such as vivaldi corelli and torelli he learnt how to write dramatic openings and adopted their sunny dispositions dynamic motor rhythms and decisive harmonic schemes bach inducted himself into these stylistic aspects largely by transcribing for harpsichord and organ the ensemble concertos of vivaldi these works are still concert favourites he may have picked up the idea of transcribing the latest fashionable italian music from prince johann ernst one of his employers who was a musician of professional calibre in one seven one three the duke returned from a tour of the low countries with a large collection of scores some of them possibly transcriptions of the latest fashionable italian music by the blind organist jan jacob de graaf he was particularly attracted to the italian solo tutti structure in which one or more solo instruments alternate section by section with the full orchestra throughout a movement these italianate features can be heard in the excerpt below of the prelude to english suite no three for harpsichord one seven one four the solo tutti alternation is achieved when the player deftly changes between the lower keyboard of a fuller slightly louder tone and the upper keyboard of a more delicate tone in weimar he had the opportunity to play and compose for the organ and to perform a varied repertoire of concert music with the duke s ensemble a master of contrapuntal technique bach s steady output of fugues began in weimar the largest single body of his fugal writing is das wohltemperierte clavier the well tempered keyboard clavier meaning keyboard instrument it consists of four eight preludes and fugues one pair for each major and relative minor key this is a monumental work for its masterful use of counterpoint and its exploration for the first time of the full range of keys and the means of expression made possible by their slight differences from each other available to keyboardists when their instruments are tuned according to systems such as that of andreas werckmeister during his tenure at weimar bach started work on the little organ book for his eldest son wilhelm friedemann this contains traditional lutheran chorales hymn tunes set in complex textures to assist the training of organists the book illustrates two major themes in bach s life his dedication to teaching and his love of the chorale as a musical form c then one seven one seven two three the palace and gardens at c then in an engraving from matth us merian s topographia one six five zero violin sonata no one in g minor bwv one zero zero one in bach s handwriting sensing increasing political tensions in the ducal court of weimar bach began once again to search out a more stable job that was conducive to his musical interests prince leopold of anhalt c then hired bach to serve as his kapellmeister director of music prince leopold himself a musician appreciated bach s talents paid him well and gave him considerable latitude in composing and performing however the prince was calvinist and did not use elaborate music in his worship thus most of bach s work from this period was secular including the orchestral suites the six suites for solo cello and the sonatas and partitas for solo violin this photograph of the opening page of the first violin sonata shows the composer s handwriting fast and efficient but just as visually ornate as the music it encoded the well known brandenburg concertos date from this period the sound clip is from the opening of the presto from the fourth brandenburg concerto for solo violin two solo flutes strings and harpsichord continuo this shows the cumulative power of the composer s fugal writing supported by the harpsichord each instrument enters in succession with a jaunty melody sounding against a complex web of counterpoint played by those that have already entered on seven july one seven two zero while bach was abroad with prince leopold tragedy struck his wife maria barbara died suddenly the following year the widower met anna magdalena willy in high priest of harmful matter which made him renowned for his anti censorship stance after the disbandment of the dead kennedys in one nine eight eight biafra and alain jourgensen of the band ministry formed the band lard the band became a side project for the members of ministry with biafra providing vocals while working on the film terminal city ricochet in one nine eight nine biafra did a song for the film s soundtrack with d o a as a result biafra worked together with d o a on the album last scream of the missing neighbors biafra also worked with nomeansno on the soundtrack which lead to their collaboration on the album the sky is falling and i want my mommy the following year on may seven one nine nine four people who believed biafra was a sell out attacked him at the nine two four gilman street club in berkeley california biafra claims that he was attacked by a man nicknamed creton who crashed into him while slamdancing the crash broke biafra s leg causing an argument between the two men during the argument creton pushed biafra to the floor and five or six friends of creton assaulted biafra while he was down yelling sellout rock star kick him biafra was later hospitalized with serious injuries the attack derailed biafra s plans for both a canadian spoken word tour and an accompanying album in october of one nine nine eight former members of the dead kennedys sued biafra for not paying them royalties due to them according to biafra the suit resulted from his refusal to allow the band s most famous single holiday in cambodia to be used in a commercial for levi s dockers biafra opposes levi s because he believes that they use unfair business practices and sweatshop labor the three former members claim that their motive had nothing to do with advertising but because biafra denied them royalties and failed to promote their albums biafra maintains that he did not deny them royalties and in addition he claims that he is not receiving any royalties on the rereleases of their albums or posthumous live albums licensed to other labels by the decay music partnership he also complained about the songwriting credits of the new reissues and archival live albums which miscredit songs that biafra composed alone to the entire band contradicting information on bmi s online database in two zero zero zero a jury ordered biafra to pay two zero zero zero zero zero to the plaintifs after an appeal by biafra s lawyers in june two zero zero three the california court of appeals unanimously upheld all the conditions of the two zero zero zero verdict against biafra and alternative tentacles the other band members reunited without biafra under the name of dk kennedys replacing biafra first with brandon cruz then with jeff penalty dead kennedys fans have criticized the new band owing to biafra s absence biafra himself has also openly criticized his former bandmates legal tactics and reunion tours most notably in the song those dumb punk kids will buy anything in one nine nine nine biafra and other members of the anti globalization movement protested the wto meeting of one nine nine nine in seattle along with other famous musicians from the west coast he formed the short lived band the no wto combo to help promote the movement s cause the band was originally scheduled to play during the protest but the performance was canceled due to riots the band performed the following night at the showbox in downtown seattle outside of the curfew area where they played a short set the hiphop group spearhead also played at the event a cd containing recordings from the concert titled live from the battle in seattle was later released in two zero zero zero the new york state green party drafted biafra as a candidate for the green party presidential nomination and a few supporters were elected to the party s nominating convention in denver colorado despite the fact that his address to the convention was positively received the party overwhelmingly chose ralph nader as the presidential candidate biafra along with a camera crew dubbed by biafra as the camcorder truth jihad later reported for the independent media center at the republican and democratic conventions biafra detailed these events in his album become the media which has resulted in him being credited with coining the slogan don t hate the media become the media indymedia and related alternative media often use this line or the now more apt don t hate the media be the media also in two zero zero zero biafra gave the keynote speech at the h two k hacker conference though biafra had never used a computer in his life the attendants saw him as being capable of drawing insightful connections between hacking and activism he has also spoken at the two zero zero two and two zero zero four conferences and audio of these speeches are freely available online for download in april of two zero zero one biafra took part in a protest against the free trade agreement of the americas conference in quebec in two zero zero five biafra appeared on episode two eight five of this american life themed know your enemy which featured a phone call between jello biafra and michael guarino the prosecutor in the frankenchrist trial the episode was about guarino s change of opinion and the reconciliation between guarino and biafra as of late two zero zero five biafra currently performs with the band the melvins the new band was dubbed jello biafra and the melvins though fans often refer to them as the jelvins together they have released two albums music cover to fresh fruit for rotting vegetables the dead kennedys debut album biafra has been a prominent member of the californian punk rock scene and while a member of the dead kennedys was one of the founding members of the san francisco hardcore punk scene the dead kennedys was one of the first u s punk bands to write politically themed songs possibly inspired by black flag another major californian punk rock band of the era the lyrics biafra wrote with the dead kennedys helped popularize the use of humorous lyrics in punk rock biafra cites joey ramone as the inspiration for his use of humor in his songs as well as being the musician who made him interested in punk rock noting in particular songs by the ramones such as beat on the brat and now i wanna sniff some glue many later punk rock bands would cite the dead kennedys as a major influence hardcore punk author steven blush describes biafra as hardcore s biggest star who was a powerful presence whose political insurgence and rabid fandom made him the father figure of a burgeoning subculture and a inspirational force who could also be a real prick biafra was a visionary incendiary performer biafra s initially attempted to compose music on guitar but his inexperience on the instrument and his own admission of being a fumbler with my hands led dead kennedys bassist klaus flouride to suggest that biafra simply sing the parts he was envisioning to the band biafra would later sing his riffs melodies and bridges into a tape recorder which he brought to the bands recording sessions this would later become an issue when the dead kennedys sued biafra over royalties and publishing rights by all accounts biafra is not a conventionally skilled musician though he and his collaborators attest that he is a skilled composer and his work particularly with the dead kennedys is highly respected by punk oriented critics and fans biafra s first popular song was the first single by the dead kennedys california ber alles the song which spoofed california governor jerry brown was the first of many political songs by the group and biafra the song s popularity resulted in it being covered by other musicians such as the disposable heroes of hiphoprisy who rewrote the lyrics to parody pete wilson and john linnell of they might be giants not long afterward the dead kennedys made a second and bigger hit with holiday in cambodia a song about the khmer rouge in cambodia from their debut album fresh fruit for rotting vegetables all music guide cited this song as possibly the most successful single of the american hardcore scene minor hits from the album included kill the poor about potential abuse of the then new neutron bomb and a satirical cover of elvis presley s viva las vegas the dead kennedys received some controversy in the spring of one nine eight one over the single too drunk to fuck the song became a big hit in britain and the bbc feared that it would manage to be a big enough hit to appear among the top three zero songs on the national charts requiring them to play a performance of the song on top of the pops however the single s popularity was slightly less than what was required peaking at the three one st position later albums would also contain memorable songs but with less popularity than the earlier ones the ep album in god we trust inc contained the song nazi punks fuck off as well as we ve got a bigger problem now a rewritten version of california ber alles about ronald reagan punk scholar vic bondi considers the latter song to be the song that defined the lyrical agenda of much of hardcore music and represented its break with punk the band s most controversial album frankenchrist brought with it the song mtv get off the air which accused mtv of promoting poor quality music and sedating the public after the dead kennedys disbanded biafra s new songs were recorded with other bands releasing only spoken word albums as solo projects these collaborations had less popularity than biafra s earlier work however his song that s progress originally recorded with d o a for the album last scream of the missing neighbors received considerable exposure when it appeared on the album rock against bush vol one biafra is an ardent collector of unusual vinyl records of all kinds from five zero s and six zero s ethno pop recordings by the likes of les baxter and esquivel to vanity pressings that have circulated regionally to infamous german crooner heino he cites his always growing collection as one of his biggest musical influences in one nine nine three he gave an interview to re search publications for their second incredibly strange music book focusing primarily on these records his heavy interest in such recordings eventually led to biafra discovering the prolific and schizophrenic singer songwriter artist wesley willis whom he signed to alternative tentacles in one nine nine four precluding willis major label deal with american recordings his collection grew so large that on october one two zero zero five biafra donated a portion of his collection to an annual yard sale co promoted by alternative tentacles and held at their warehouse in emeryville california political beliefs cover to machine gun in the clown s hand one of biafra s spoken word albums biafra claims to be an anarchist in his personal dealings with people though he does not advocate replacing current governments with an anarchic system he claims that mankind is not yet ready for anarchy and still needs government to control the order of human life for the safety and progression of human events in speeches he has advised people to partake in civil disobedience political pranks and hacktivism some such acts that he has advocated include hacking corporate owned websites and planting marijuana seeds in public areas biafra was a swift critic of the parents music resource center during the one nine eight zero s and has constantly criticized co founder tipper gore as well as the tipper sticker a warning placed on records indicating explicit content biafra confronted her twice on episodes of the oprah winfrey show many of the songs he wrote for the dead kennedys during the eight zero s showed opposition to the religious right and ronald reagan in the one nine nine zero s biafra s opposition to the right continued with his opposition to george h w bush and the gulf war though he also was opposed to some practices of democratic president bill clinton most notable among these are biafra s opposition to the united states involvement with nafta gatt and the world trade organization biafra advocates what he refers to as the maximum wage increasing taxes for the wealthy and eliminating taxes for those in the lower and middle class on top of this the maximum wage would close tax loopholes for both large corporations and religious organizations he has advocated using these taxes to provide the public with several free services including free health care free education including amnesty on student loans and free transportation other uses for these taxes would also include subsidies for the arts organic farms hemp and kanaf farms urban squatters and renewable energy sources biafra has advocated ending the death penalty in the united states in his address to the green party he chose death row inmate mumia abu jamal whom anti death penalty activists believe was wrongly accused of murder as his vice presidential candidate to help point out his stance on the issue as well as attract attention to abu jamal s situation because of his support of abu jamal which includes releasing spoken word albums by him on alternative tentacles biafra is now on a fraternal order of police boycott list he has also proposed ending police brutality by making officers stand for public election every four years biafra believes in ending the war on drugs by legalizing marijuana and other narcotics he believes drug addicts should be treated instead of jailed and should be given legal outlets to get drugs from thus eliminating illegal drug sales he also advocates ending jail sentences for minor non violent drug related offenses in drug education for public schools biafra advocates educating students on drugs by using demonstrations of drug use in classes and allowing experimentation in controlled environments to help reduce the possibility of addiction these he believes would provide an alternative to anti drug advertising which he believes does not work he also advocates ending drug testing of employees and students other subjects that biafra advocates include anti gentrification election reform increasing the amount of low income housing gay rights eliminating sport utility vehicles from urban areas labeling of genetically modified food and withdrawal from nafta and the world trade organization he also claims to be a supporter of the green party s ten key values because of biafra s use of sarcasm and humor the public does not always take his positions seriously his use of joke propositions such as forcing polluters to swim in the pollution they caused until they clean it provide humor in his speeches but turn off some people from his ideas this was most notable during his run for mayor of san francisco still supporters of biafra see his comedic approach as a useful way of getting the public to hear about issues that are not always addressed by other politicians samples discography a short list of original albums only for a detailed list including compilations

green politicians human rights activists living people musical activists people from colorado premature obituaries punk rock musicians john grierson april two six one eight nine eight february one nine one nine seven two is often considered the father of british and canadian documentary film early life grierson was born in deanston scotland his father was the local school master his mother an early feminist and ardent labor activist from an early age both parents steeped their son in liberal politics humanistic ideals and calvinist moral and religious philosophies particularly the notion that education was essential to individual freedom and that hard and meaningful work was the way to prove oneself worth in the sight of god after a stint working on minesweepers in the royal navy during world war i grierson entered the university of glasgow where he spent a good part of his academic career enmeshed in impassioned political discussion and leftist political activism in one nine two four after graduating from the university in moral philosophy he received a rockefeller research fellowship to study in the us at the university of chicago and later at columbia and the university of wisconsin his research focus was the psychology of propaganda the impact of the press film and other mass media on forming public opinion grierson was particularly interested in the popular appeal and influence of the yellow tabloid press and the influence and role of these journals on the education of new american citizens from abroad social critic like a number of other social critics of the time grierson was profoundly concerned about what he perceived to be clear threats to democracy in the us he encountered a marked tendency toward political reaction anti democratic sentiments and political apathy he read and agreed with the journalist and political philosopher walter lippman s book public opinion which blamed the erosion of democracy in part on the fact that the political and social complexities of contemporary society made it difficult if not impossible for the public to comprehend and respond to issues vital to the maintenance of democratic society in grierson s view a way to counter these problems was to involve citizens in their government with the kind of engaging excitement generated by the popular press which simplified and dramatized public affair it was during this time that grierson developed a conviction that motion pictures could play a central role in promoting this process it has been suggested some of grierson s notions regarding the social and political uses of film were influenced by reading lenin s s writing about film as education and propaganda grierson s emerging view of film was as a form of social and political communication a mechanism for social reform education and perhaps spiritual uplift his view of hollywood movie making was considerably less sanguine in an age when the faiths the loyalties and the purposes have been more than usually undermined mental fatigue or is it spiritual fatigue represents a large factor in everyday experience our cinema magnate does no more than exploit the occasion he also more or less frankly is a dope pedlar film critic grierson s emerging and outspoken film philosophies caught the attention of new york film critics at the time he was asked to write criticism for the new york sun at the sun grierson wrote articles on film aesthetics and audience reception and developed broad contacts in the film world in the course of this writing stint grierson coined the term documentary in writing about robert flaherty s film moana ny sun february eight one nine two six of course moana being a visual account of events in the daily life of a polynesian youth and his family has documentary value during this time grierson was also involved in scrutinizing the film industries of other countries he was involved in arranging to bring sergei eisenstein s groundbreaking film the battleship potemkin to us audience for the fist time eisenstein s editing techniques and film theories particularly the use of montage would have a significant influence on grierson s own work filmmaker grierson returned to great britain in the late one nine two zero s armed with the sense that film could be enlisted to deal with the problems of the great depression and to build national morale and national consensus filmmaking for grierson was an exalted calling the filmmaker a patriot in all of this there was more than a little elitism a stance reflected in grierson s many dicta of the time the elect have their duty i look on cinema as a pulpit and use it as a propagandist in the us grierson had met pioneering documentary filmmaker robert flaherty grierson respected flaherty immensely for his contributions to documentary form and his attempts to use the camera to bring alive the lives of everyday people and everyday events less commendable in grierson s view was flaherty s focus on exotic and faraway cultures in the profounder kind of way wrote grierson of flaherty we live and prosper each of us by denouncing the other in grierson s view the focus of film should be on the everyday drama of ordinary people as grierson wrote in his diaries beware the ends of the earth and the exotic the drama is on your doorstep wherever the slums are wherever there is malnutrition wherever there is exploitation and cruelty you keep your savages in the far place bob we are going after the savages of birmingham i think i said to him pretty early on and we did on his return to england grierson joined the empire marketing board emb a governmental agency which had been established several years earlier to promote british world trade and british unity throughout the empire one of the major functions of the emb was publicity which the board accomplished thru exhibits posters and publications in one nine three zero grierson convinced government funding agencies to establish a film unit within the emb and to assign him the directorship of the unit it was within the context of this state funded organization that the documentary as we know it today really got its start in late one nine two nine grierson and his cameraman basil emmott completed his first film the drifters which he wrote produced and directed the film which follows the heroic work of north sea herring fishermen was a radical departure from anything being made by the british film industry or hollywood a large part of its innovation lie in the fierce boldness in bringing the camera to rugged locations such as a small boat in the middle of a gale and leave relatively less of the action staged the choice of topic was chosen less from grierson s curiosity than the fact that he discovered the financial secretary had made the herring industry his hobbyhorse it premiered in london on a double bill with eisenstein s then controversial film the battleship potemkin and received high praise from both its sponsors and the press after this success grierson moved away from film direction into more production and administration within the emb he became a tireless organizer and recruiter for the emb enlisting a stable of energetic young filmmakers into the film unit between one nine three zero and one nine three three those enlisted included filmmakers basil wright edgar anstey stuart legg paul rotha arthur elton humphrey jennings harry watt and alberto cavalcanti this group formed the core of what was to become known as the british documentary movement in one nine three three the emb film unit was disbanded a casualty of depression era economics grierson s boss at the emb moved to the general post office gpo as its first public relations officer with the stipulation that he could bring the emb film unit with him grierson s crew were charged with demonstrating the ways in which the post office facilitated modern communication and brought the nation together a task aimed as much at gpo workers as the general public during grierson s administration the gpo film unit produced a series of groundbreaking films including night mail dir basil wright and harry watt one nine three six and coal face dir alberto cavalcanti one nine three six grierson eventually grew restless with having to work within the bureaucratic and budgetary confines of government sponsorship in response he sought out private industry sponsorship for film production he was finally successful in getting the british gas industry to underwrite an annual film program perhaps the most significant works produced during this time were housing problems dir arthur elton edgar anstey john taylor and grierson s sister ruby grierson one nine three five and song of ceylon dir basil wright one nine three five in one nine three eight grierson was invited by the canadian government to study the country s film production he proposed the government create a national coordinating body for the production of films in one nine three nine canada created the national film commission which would later become the national film board of canada grierson was the first commissioner of the board when canada entered world war ii in one nine three nine the nfb focused on the production of propaganda films many of which grierson directed after the war it focused on producing documentaries that reflected the lives of canadians the nfb is recognized around the world for producing quality films many of which have won academy awards from one nine five seven to one nine six seven grierson hosted a successful weekly

people with around one four million followers as of two zero zero five it is one of the first recorded monotheistic faiths and one of the oldest religious traditions still practiced today the values and history of the jewish people are a major part of the foundation of other abrahamic religions such as samaritanism christianity and islam the seven branched menorah is an ancient symbol of judaism it was used in the temple in ancient jerusalem judaism has seldom if ever been monolithic in practice and has not had any centralized authority or binding dogma despite this judaism in all its variations has remained tightly bound to a number of religious principles the most important of which is the belief in a single omniscient omnipotent omnibenevolent transcendent god who created the universe and continues to be involved in its governance according to jewish thought the god who created the world established a covenant with the jewish people and revealed his laws and commandments to them in the form of the torah the practice of judaism is devoted to the study and observance of these laws and commandments as they are interpreted according to the tanakh halakha responsa and rabbinic literature judaism does not fit easily into conventional western categories such as religion ethnicity or culture in part because of its four zero zero zero year history during this time jews have experienced slavery anarchic and theocratic self government conquest occupation and exile they have been in contact with and have been influenced by ancient egyptian babylonian persian and hellenic cultures as well as modern movements such as the enlightenment see haskalah and the rise of nationalism thus talmud professor daniel boyarin has argued that jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity because it is not national not genealogical not religious but all of these in dialectical tension introduction according to both traditional judaism and modern scholars a number of qualities distinguish judaism from the other religions that existed when it first emerged one characteristic was monotheism the significance of this idea according to critical historian yehezkal kaufman lies in that judaism holds that god created and cares about humankind in polytheistic religions humankind is often created by accident and the gods are primarily concerned with their relations with other gods not with people second the torah specifies a number of commandments to be followed by the children of israel other religions at the time were characterized by temples in which priests would worship their gods through sacrifice the children of israel similarly had a temple in jerusalem priests and made sacrifices but these were not the sole means of worshiping god monotheism scholars argue as to when the notion of monotheism arose judaism claims that it is expressed directly in torah the hebrew bible where god incorporates it into the ten commandments i am the lord your god do not have any other gods before me do not represent such gods by any carved statue or picture of anything in the heaven above on the earth below or in the water below the land do not bow down to such gods or worship them i am god your lord a god who demands exclusive worship exodus two zero deuteronomy five thus the beliefs in the existence of god god s eternal nature god as the sole creator of all that exists and god s determination of the course of events in this world are the foundations of the judaistic religion i am the lord your god who brought you out of the land of egypt to turn from these beliefs is to deny god and the essence of judaism according to the jewish understanding of the ten commandments furthermore one is required to believe in god and god alone this prohibits belief in or worship of any additional deities gods spirits or incarnations the idea of god as a duality or trinity is heretical for jews to hold it is considered akin to polytheism to deny the uniqueness of god is to deny all that is written in the torah you shall have no other gods besides me do not make a sculpted image or any likeness of what is in the heavens above it is also a prohibition against making or possessing objects that one may bow down to or serve such as crucifixes or icons and any forms of paintings or artistic representations of god one must not bow down to or serve any being or object but god see ten commandments jewish interpretation the significance of the idea is that an omniscient and omnipotent god created humankind as recorded in the book of genesis in the creation according to genesis starting with the very first verse of genesis one one in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth a marked contrast with polytheistic religions in which the gods are limited by their preoccupation with personal desires irrelevant to humankind by their limited powers or by the interference of other powers in judaism god is unlimited fully capable and fully available to care for creation practical worship and the laws the torah i e the hebrew bible specifies a number of laws known as the six one three mitzvot to be followed by the children of israel other religions at the time were characterized by temples in which priests would worship their gods through sacrifice the children of israel similarly had a temple in jerusalem a caste of priests and made sacrifices but these were not the sole means of worshipping god as a matter of practical worship in comparison to other religions judaism seeks to elevate everyday life to the level of the ancient temple s worship by worshipping god through the spectrum of daily activities and actions judaism maintains that this is how the individual will merit rewards in the afterlife called gan eden hebrew garden of eden or olam haba world to come though judaism does not have a single concept of the afterlife nor is the afterlife the focus of jewish practice traditional view of the development of judaism scenes from the book of esther part of the ketuvim portion of the tanakh decorate the dura europos synagogue dating from two four four ce the subject of the hebrew bible is an account of the israelites also called hebrews relationship with god as reflected in their history from the beginning of time until the building of the second temple ca three five zero bce this relationship is generally portrayed as contentious as jews struggle between their faith in god and their attraction for other gods and as some jews such as abraham most notably and directly jacob later known as israel and moses struggle with god according to orthodox judaism and most religious jews the biblical patriarch abraham was the first hebrew rabbinic literature records that he was the first to reject idolatry and preach monotheism as a result god promised he would have children look now toward heaven and count the stars so shall be your progeny genesis one five five abraham s first child was ishmael and his second son was isaac whom god said would continue abraham s work and inherit the land of israel then called canaan after having been exiled and redeemed god sent the patriarch jacob and his children to egypt where after many generations they became enslaved then god sent moses to redeem the israelites from slavery and after the exodus from egypt god led the jews to mount sinai and gave them the torah eventually bringing them to the land of israel god designated the descendants of aaron moses brother to be a priestly class within the israelite community they first officiated in the tabernacle a portable house of worship and later their descendants were in charge of worship in the temple in jerusalem once the jews had settled in the land of israel the tabernacle was planted in the city of shiloh for over three zero zero years during which time god provided great men and occasionally women to rally the nation against attacking enemies some of which were sent by god as a punishment for the sins of the people this is described in the book of joshua and the book of judges as time went on the spiritual level of the nation declined to the point that god allowed the philistines to capture the tabernacle in shiloh the people of israel then told samuel the prophet that they had reached the point where they needed to be governed by a permanent king as were other nations as described in the books of samuel samuel grudgingly acceded to this request and appointed saul a great but very humble man to be their king when the people pressured saul into going against a command conveyed to him by samuel god told samuel to appoint david in his stead once king david was established he told the prophet nathan that he would like to build a permanent temple and as a reward for his actions god promised david that he would allow his son to build the temple and the throne would never depart from his children david himself was not allowed to build the temple because he had been involved in many wars making it inappropriate for him to build a temple representing peace as a result it was david s son solomon who built the first permanent temple according to god s will in jerusalem as described in the books of kings the western wall in jerusalem is all that is known to remain of the second temple the temple mount is the holiest site in judaism after solomon s death his kingdom was split into the two kingdoms of israel and judah after several hundred years because of rampant idolatry god allowed assyria to conquer israel and exile its people the southern kingdom of judah whose capital was jerusalem home of the temple remained under the rulership of the house of david however as in the north idolatry increased to the point that god allowed babylonia to conquer the kingdom destroy the temple which had stood for four one zero years and exile its people to babylonia with the promise that they would be redeemed after seventy years these events are recorded in the book of isaiah and the book of jeremiah after seventy years the jews were allowed back into israel under the leadership of ezra and the temple was rebuilt as recorded in the book of ezra and the book of nehemiah the second temple stood for four two zero years after which it was destroyed by the roman general later emperor titus the jewish temple is to remain in ruins until a descendant of david arises to restore the glory of israel and rebuild the temple in jerusalem the torah given on mount sinai was summarized in the five books of moses together with the books of the prophets it is called the written torah the details and interpretation of the law which are called the oral torah or oral law were originally unwritten however as the persecutions of the jews increased and the details were in danger of being forgotten rabbinic tradition holds that these oral laws were recorded in the mishnah and the talmud as well as other holy books critical historical view of the development of judaism although monotheism is fundamental to rabbinic judaism many critical bible scholars claim that certain verses in the torah imply that the early israelites accepted the existence of other gods while viewing their god as the sole creator whose worship is obligated a rather henotheistic point of view according to them it was only by the hellenic period that most jews came to believe that their god was the only god and thus the god of everyone and that the record of his revelation the torah contained within it universal truths they posit that this attitude reflected a growing gentile interest in judaism some greeks and romans considered the jews a most philosophical people because of their belief in a god that cannot be represented visually and growing jewish interest in greek philosophy which sought to establish universal truths thus leading potentially to the idea of monotheism at least in the sense that all gods are one new evidence supporting the existence of a polytheistic precursor to judaism was unearthed in the discovery of ugarit where ancient tablets were found that describe a pantheon of gods that includes several gods mentioned in the torah according to this theory jews began to grapple with the tension between their claims of particularism that only jews were required to obey the torah and universalism that the torah contained universal truths the supposed result is a set of beliefs and practices concerning identity ethics and the relationships between man and nature and man and god that examine and privilege differences for example the difference between jews and non jews the local differences in the practice of judaism a close attention when interpreting texts to difference in the meanings of three words attempts to preserve and encode different points of view within texts and a relative avoidance of creed and dogma in contrast to the orthodox religious view of the hebrew bible critical biblical scholars also suggest that the torah consists of a variety of inconsistent texts that were edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts see documentary hypothesis religious doctrine and principles of faith while judaism has always affirmed a number of jewish principles of faith no creed dogma set of orthodox beliefs or fully binding catechism is recognized an approach to religious doctrine that dates back at least two thousand years and that makes generalizations about jewish theology somewhat difficult while individual rabbis congregations or movements have at times agreed upon a firm dogma generally other rabbis and groups have disagreed and because there is explicitly no central religious authority no specific formulation of jewish principles of faith could take precedence over any other in attempting to define who is a jew the ancient historian josephus  five value is the second wealthiest and princeton with one one two billion

because they didn t fit well in people s wallets almost all of the original notes have been removed from circulation the first issue of ithaca money was printed at our press in chenango bridge ny on

hours went into circulation greenstar cooperative market burned down local food vendors selling through greenstar quickly organized a mini market on henry st johns school and most of them decided to accept hours this provided hours with a midwinter food base right from the beginning transition to a board the advisory board incorporated the ithaca hour system as ithaca hours inc in october one

wolf bob leroy legrace benson wally woods jennifer elges and donald stephenson in may of one nine nine nine paul glover turned the administration of ithaca hours over to the newly elected board of

union the public library many local farmers movie theatres restaurants healers plumbers carpenters electricians and landlords one of the primary functions of the ithaca hours system is to promote local economic development businesses who receive hours must spend them on local goods and services thus building a network of inter supporting local businesses while non local businesses are welcome to accept hours those businesses need to spend them on local goods and services to be economically sustainable in their mission to promote local economic development the board of directors also makes

zero four the stars irradiate the gas with energetic ultraviolet light stripping electrons from atoms and exciting them producing a characteristic nebular glow chemical compositions analysing the composition of interstellar clouds is achieved by studying electromagnetic radiation that we receive from them large radio telescopes scan the intensity in the sky of particular frequencies of electromagnetic radiation which are characteristic of certain molecules spectra some interstellar clouds are cold and tend to give out em radiation of large wavelengths we can produce a map of the abundance of these molecules to produce an understanding of the varying composition of the clouds in hot clouds there are often ions of many elements whose spectra can be seen in visible and ultraviolet light radio telescopes can also scan over the frequencies from one point in the map recording the intensities of each type of molecule peaks of frequencies mean that an abundance of that molecule or atom is present in the cloud the height of the peak is proportional to the relative percentage that it makes up unexpected chemicals detected in interstellar clouds until recently the rates of reactions in interstellar clouds were expected to be very slow with minimal products being produced due to the low temperature and density of the clouds however large organic molecules were observed in the spectra that scientists would not have expected to find under these conditions the reactions needed to create them normally only occur at much higher temperatures and pressures the fact that they were found indicates that these chemical reactions in interstellar clouds take place faster than suspected these reactions are studied in the cresu experiment see also interstellar

the convention on the prevention of maritime pollution marpol seven three seven eight which required double hulls on all tankers all these initiatives were instigated by representatives of the united states before the imo the concept of imo was born after the rms titanic disaster by modern standards the design of the titanic made her appallingly vulnerable her watertight bulkheads by design did not extend all the way to the overhead because the engineers calculated that it was impossible for the ship to take on a trim or list sufficient for water to cascade over their tops if the bulkheads were of a certain height when titanic struck the iceberg these calculations were proven dismally incorrect when people began abandoning ship it became obvious that not nearly enough lifeboats were available many lives and much money were lost in this tragedy up until that time each nation had made its own rules about ship design construction and safety equipment the inter governmental maritime consultative organization imco was formed in response to the titanic event but was put on the back burner when world war i broke out after the war ended imco was revived and produced a group of regulations concerning shipbuilding and safety called safety of life at sea solas through the years solas has been modified and upgraded to adapt to changes in technology and lessons learned imco

switzerland founded in one nine one nine it was formed through the negotiations of the treaty of versailles and was initially an agency of the league of nations it became a un body after the demise of the league and the formation of the un at the end of world war ii its current charter the declaration of philadelphia was adopted in one nine four four its secretariat or support staff is known as the international labour office the organization seeks to strengthen worker rights improve working conditions and living conditions create employment and provide information and training opportunities ilo programmes include the occupational safety and health hazard alert system and the labour standards and human rights programmes historically one of the functions the ilo has performed has been the establishment of international standards for workers conditions which have then become the basis for trade union and other activism in individual countries it is a relatively low profile un agency compared to some of those more active in crises such as the world health organization international labour conference the ilo hosts the international labour conference in geneva every year in june at the conference conventions and recommendations are crafted and adopted by majority decision the conference also makes decisions on the ilo s general policy work programme and budget each member state is represented at the international labour conference by four delegates two government delegates an employer delegate and a worker delegate all delegates have individual voting rights and all votes are equal regardless of the population of the delegate s member state the employer and worker delegates are normally chosen in agreement with the most representative national organizations of employers and workers usually the worker delegates coordinate their voting as do the employer delegates conventions the decision making process of the ilo means that conventions need government support to be adopted despite this not all governments voting for a convention end up ratifying it for instance after ten years the part time work convention adopted in one nine nine four had been ratified by only ten countries on the other hand a group of eight conventions defined by the ilo as fundamental have enjoyed far wider recognition these have all been ratified by a majority of the member states and are known as the international labour standards with the ratification of a convention comes a legal obligation to apply its provisions governments are required to submit reports detailing their compliance with the obligations of the resolutions they have ratified every year the international labour conference s committee on the application of standards examine a number of suspected breaches of ilo labour standards cases can cover all areas of policy and practice e g freedom of association discrimination child labour and maternity protection in recent years one of the member states that has received the most attention is myanmar as the country has repeatedly been criticized for its failure to guarantee fundamental worker s rights the ilo s repeated expression of grave concern in this case also illustrates the organization s lack of sanction possibilities recomendations recommendations do not have the binding force of conventions and are not subject to ratification by member countries recommendations may be adopted at the same time as conventions to supplement the latter with additional or more detailed provisions the intent of these recomendations is often to more precisely detail the priciples of related conventions in other cases recommendations may be adopted separately and address issues not covered by or unrelated to any particular

campephilus principalis is a very large and extremely rare member of the woodpecker family picidae it is officially listed as an endangered species and until recently had widely been considered extinct however highly compelling sightings of at least one male bird in arkansas in two zero zero four and two zero zero five were reported in april two zero zero five abstract and audio evidence suggesting the presence of the bird has also been collected if its rediscovery is confirmed this would make the ivory billed woodpecker a lazarus species the ivory billed woodpecker is the second largest woodpecker in the world slightly smaller than the closely related imperial woodpecker c imperialis of western mexico another rare species which is very likely to be extinct it measures from four eight to five three cm one nine to two one in in length and four five zero to five seven zero g one zero to one two five lb in weight with short legs and feet ending in large curved claws the bird is shiny blue black with extensive white markings on its neck and on both the upper and lower trailing edges of its wings it has a pure white bill and displays a prominent top crest red in the male and black in the female these characteristics distinguish it from the darker billed pileated woodpecker like all woodpeckers it has a strong and straight chisel like bill and a long mobile hard tipped barbed tongue its drum is a single or double rap and its alarm call a kent or hant sounds like a toy trumpet repeated in a series or as a double note the reason for the species decline was primarily due to loss of habitat and also hunting by collectors even if the ivory billed woodpecker is not extinct most believe that only a handful could still be living habitat and diet ivory billeds are known to prefer thick hardwood swamps and pine forests with large amounts of dead and decaying trees prior to the american civil war much of the southern united states was covered in vast tracts of primeval hardwood forests that were suitable as habitat for the bird at that time the ivory billed woodpecker ranged from east texas to north carolina and from southern illinois to florida and cuba after the civil war the timber industry deforested millions of acres in the south leaving only sparse isolated tracts of suitable habitat the ivory billed woodpecker feeds mainly on the larvae of wood boring beetles but also eats seeds fruit and other insects the bird uses its enormous white bill to hammer wedge and peel the bark off dead trees to find the insects surprisingly these birds need about two five km one zero square miles per pair so they can find enough food to feed their young and themselves hence they occur at low densities even in healthy populations the more common pileated woodpecker may compete for food with this species breeding biology the ivory billed woodpecker is thought to pair for life pairs are also known to travel together these paired birds will mate every year between january and may before they have their young they excavate a nest in a dead or partially dead tree about eight one five m up from the ground usually two to five eggs are laid and incubated for three to five weeks both parents sit on the eggs and are involved in taking care of the chicks with the male taking sole responsibility at night they feed the chicks for months about five weeks after the young are born they learn to fly even after the young are able to fly the parents will continue feeding them for another two months the whole family will eventually split up in late fall or early winter conservation status heavy logging activity and hunting by collectors decimated the population of ivory billed woodpeckers in the late one eight zero zero s it was generally considered extinct in the one nine two zero s when a pair turned up in florida only to be shot for specimens by one nine three eight an estimated two zero individuals remained in the wild located in the old growth forest called the singer tract in louisiana where logging rights were held by the chicago mill and lumber company which brushed aside pleas from four southern governors and the national audubon society that the tract be publicly purchased and set aside as a reserve by one nine four four the last known ivory billed woodpecker a female was gone from the cut over tract smithsonian p nine eight the ivory billed woodpecker was listed as an endangered species on march one one one nine six seven though the only evidence of its existence at the time was a possible recording of its call made in east texas the last reported sighting of the cuban subspecies c p bairdii after a long interval was in one nine eight seven it has not been seen since there were occasional scattered reports of the bird but many ornithologists believed the species had been wiped out completely and it was assessed as extinct by the international union for conservation of nature and natural resources in one nine nine four this assessment was later altered to critically endangered on the grounds that the species could still be extant pearl river expedition in one nine nine nine there was an unconfirmed sighting of a pair of birds in the pearl river region of southeast louisiana by a forestry student david kulivan in a two zero zero two expedition in the forests swamps and bayous of the pearl river wildlife management area by louisiana state university biologists spent three zero days searching for the bird in the afternoon of january two seven after ten days a rapping sound similar to the double knock made by the ivory billed woodpecker was heard and recorded the exact source of the sound was not found because of the swampy terrain but signs of active woodpeckers were found i e scaled bark and large tree cavities the expedition was inconclusive however as it was determined that the recorded sounds were likely gunshot echoes rather than the distinctive double rap of the ivory billed woodpecker rediscovery a group of seventeen authors headed by the cornell lab of ornithology reported the discovery of at least one ivory billed woodpecker a male in the big woods area of arkansas in two zero zero four and two zero zero five publishing the report in the journal science on april two eight two zero zero five one of the authors who was kayaking in the cache river national wildlife refuge monroe county arkansas on february one one two zero zero four reported on a website the sighting of an unusually large red crested woodpecker this report led to more intensive searches there and in the white river national wildlife refuge undertaken in deepest secrecy for fear of a stampede of bird watchers by experienced observers over the next fourteen months about fifteen sightings occurred during the period seven of which were considered compelling enough to mention in the scientific article possibly all of the same bird the secrecy permitted the nature conservancy and cornell university to quietly buy up ivory billed habitat to add to the one two zero zero zero zero acres four nine zero km of the big woods protected by the conservancy a very large woodpecker was videotaped on april two five two zero zero four its size wing pattern at rest and in flight and white plumage on its back between the wings were cited as evidence that the woodpecker sighted was an ivory billed woodpecker that same video included an earlier image of what was believed to be such a bird perching on a water tupelo nyssa aquatica the report also notes that drumming consistent with that of ivory billed woodpecker had been heard in the region it describes the potential for a thinly distributed population in the area though no birds have been located away from the primary site a current concern is that many bird enthusiasts will rush to the area in an attempt to catch a glimpse of this rare bird this is exactly what birders have been encouraged not to do by experts to avoid disturbing the birds there are stories from when the species was more abundant of adult birds abandoning their nests and young simply because they were being watched in june two zero zero five ornithologists at yale university the university of kansas and florida gulf coast university submitted a scientific article skeptical of the initial reports of rediscovery however after reviewing new sound recordings from the white river of arkansas supplied to them by the cornell team that reported the rediscovery they announced in august two zero zero five that they had concluded that the bird has indeed been rediscovered and withdrew their paper yale ornithologist richard prum stated we were very skeptical of the first published reports and thought that the previous data were not sufficient to support this startling conclusion but the thrilling new sound recordings provide clear and convincing evidence that the ivory billed woodpecker is not extinct in august two zero zero five despite the arguments for the existence of at least one ivory billed woodpecker questions about the evidence remained cornell could not say with absolute certainty that the sounds recorded in arkansas were made by ivory billeds some skeptics including richard prum believe the video could have been of a pileated woodpecker in december two zero zero five richard prum s position was presented this way prum intrigued by some of the recordings taken in arkansas big woods said the evidence thus far is refutable on page one three of the american birding association publication winging it nov dec two zero zero five it says the aba checklist committee has not changed the status of the ivory billed woodpecker from code six extinct to another level that would reflect a small surviving population the committee is waiting for unequivocal proof that the species still exists in a paper published in the auk in january two zero zero six jerome jackson expressed skepticism of the ivory bill evidence prum robbins brett benz and i remain steadfast in our belief that the bird in the luneau video is a normal pileated woodpecker others have independently come to the same conclusion and publication of independent analyses may be forthcoming for scientists to label sight reports and questionable photographs as proof of such an extraordinary record is delving into faith based ornithology and doing a disservice to science other facts the ivory billed woodpecker is sometimes referred to as the grail bird or the lord god bird a name shared with the pileated woodpecker

towards an international standard for the language it is sometimes referred to as global english world english or standard english sometimes these terms refer simply to the array of varieties of english spoken throughout the world sometimes they refer to a desired standardisation however consensus on the terminology and path to standardisation has not been reached historical context the modern concept of international english does not exist in isolation but is the product of centuries of development of the english language the language of england came to dominance throughout the island of great britain during the middle ages and in ireland during the one eight th century and especially the one nine th century in the modern era printing led to the gradual standardisation of english and particularly the use of the prestige dialect of the english ruling classes the establishment of the first permanent english speaking colony in north america in one six zero seven was a major step towards the globalisation of the language british english was only partially standardised when the american colonies were established isolated from britain by the atlantic ocean the settlements evolved a distinct standard form of american english in particular noah webster s reform of american english spelling in the early one nine th century gave rise to the main division in english spelling that exists today in the one eight th century british colonialism focused on the southern hemisphere the standardisation of british english was more settled than it had been in the previous century and this confident english was brought to africa asia and oceania it developed both as the language of english speaking settlers from britain and ireland and as the administrative language imposed on speakers of other languages in the various parts of the british empire the first form can be seen in new zealand english and the latter in indian english the term commonwealth english refers to these groups of english dialects the english speaking nations of canada and the caribbean are caught between historical connections with british and commonwealth english and geographical connections with u s english in some things and more formally they tend to follow british standards in others they follow the u s standard more recently american english has become predominant as the preferred version of english in many countries that previously either had no preferred form or preferred some variant of british english since world war ii for example the governments of china though not hong kong and japan have generally used american english though in the case of china the puncuation is a mixture of both american and british the ebb and flow between the standardisation of the language and its diversification have been ever present throughout its history the flagship of the former is intelligibility and practicality while the latter has cultural autonomy and flexibility modern global language there is a distinction between english as spoken as a native language around the world in the usa the united kingdom australia and so forth and as a non native language spoken as a regional or global lingua franca a second distinction is made between those countries where non native english has official or historical importance special significance for example in pakistan and uganda and those where it does not for example in japan and peru in the terminology of english language teaching elt we have english as a native language enl also called first language l one english as an additional language eal or english for speakers of other languages esol english as a second language esl in an environment where english has a special significance also called second language l two english as a foreign language efl in places where it has no special significance also called third language l three english as a second language might refer either to acquisition of the language in southern india where it is a prominent regional lingua franca or the acquisition of the language by a speaker of another language in a predominantly english speaking country a brazilian living in barbados for instance it may not be an individual s actual second language but perhaps third or fourth in the context of language teaching english as an additional language eal usually is based on the standards of either british commonwealth english or american english english as an international language eil is eal with emphasis on learning different major dialect forms in particular it aims to equip students with the linguistic tools to communicate internationally the term international english is used in the international english language testing system ielts an english language definition and evaluation system owned developed and delivered through the partnership of the british council idp education australia ielts australia and the university of cambridge esol examinations though concentrating on a kind of english understood almost everywhere the basic standard is taken to be commonwealth english varying concepts universality and flexibility international english sometimes refers to english as it is actually being used and developed in the world as a language owned not just by native speakers but by all those who come to use it basically it covers the english language at large often but not always or necessarily implicitly seen as standard it is certainly also commonly used in connection with the acquisition use and study of english as the world s lingua franca teil teaching english as an international language and especially when the language is considered as a whole in contrast with american english british english south african english and the like mcarthur two zero zero two p four four four four five it especially means english words and phrases generally understood throughout the english speaking world as opposed to localisms the importance of non native english language skills can be recognised behind the long standing joke that the international language of science and technology is broken english neutrality international english reaches towards cultural neutrality this has a practical use what could be better than a type of english that saves you from having to re edit publications for individual regional markets teachers and learners of english as a second language also find it an attractive idea both often concerned that their english should be neutral without british or american or canadian or australian colouring any regional variety of english has a set of political social and cultural connotations attached to it even the so called standard forms peters two zero zero four international english according to this viewpoint international english is a concept of english that minimises the aspects defined by either the colonial imperialism of victorian britain or the cultural imperialism of the two zero th century united states while british colonialism laid the foundation for english over much of the world international english is a product of an emerging world culture very much attributable to the influence of the united states as well but conceptually based on a far greater degree of cross talk and linguistic transculturation which tends to mitigate both u s influence and british colonial influence the development of international english often centres around academic and scientific communities where formal english usage is prevalent and creative and flowery use of the language is at a minimum this formal international english allows entry into western culture as a whole and western cultural values in general opposition the continued growth of the english language itself is seen by many as a kind of cultural imperialism whether it is english in one form or english in two slightly different forms robert phillipson argues against the possibility of such neutrality in his linguistic imperialism one nine nine two learners who wish to use purportedly correct english are in fact faced with the dual standard of american english and british english

standard or move towards a more neutral but artificial one a true international english might supplant both current american and british english as a variety of english for international communication leaving these as local dialects or would rise from a merger of general american and standard british english with admixture of other varieties of english and would generally replace all these varieties of english we may in due course all need to be in control of two standard englishes the one which gives us our national and local identity and the other which puts us in touch with the rest

possess a non standard dialect of english as their birth tongue but have also learned to write and perhaps also speak a more standard dialect many academics often publish material in journals requiring different varieties of english and change style and spellings as necessary without great difficulty dual standard two approaches to international english are the individualistic and inclusive approach and the new dialect approach the individualistic approach gives control to individual authors to write and spell as they wish within purported standard conventions and to accept the validity of differences the longman grammar of spoken and written english published in one nine nine nine is a descriptive study of both american and british english in which each chapter follows individual spelling conventions according to the preference of the main editor of that chapter the new dialect approach appears in the cambridge guide to english usage peters two zero zero four which attempts to avoid any language bias and accordingly uses an idiosyncratic international spelling system of mixed american and british forms but tending more to american spelling non u s english sometimes international english is used to refer to a general standard that is based on commonwealth and british english rather than u s english whereas the majority of english native speakers use american english most nations other than the united states use british commonwealth english as a standard which explains the use of the word international however u s english is having a greater influence in the rapidly expanding area of english as a foreign language due to the economic and cultural influence of the united states the international flavour of british commonwealth english is dependent on three factors british and commonwealth english are standard in far more countries around the world than u s english many academic publications outside the united states use the conventions of the oxford university press this standard of english has official status in the united nations and the european union and it is used as the basis of english language testing by the international english language testing system ielts international english is also sometimes used in this manner in the computer industry the linux community and other open software groups use the term

cells use to communicate with their physiologic environment this complex system often referred to as the igf axis consists of two cell surface receptors igf one r and igf two r two ligands igf i and igf ii a family of six high affinity igf binding proteins igfbp one six as well as associated igfbp degrading enzymes referred to collectivly as proteases this system is important for both the regulation of normal physiology as well as a number of pathological states including cancer the igf axis has been shown to play roles in the promotion of cell proliferation and the inhibition of cell death apoptosis igf ii is thought to be a primary growth factor required for early development while igf i expression is seen in later life gene knockout studies in mice have confirmed this though other animals are likely to regulate the expression of these genes in distinct ways while igf two may be primarily fetal in action it is also essential for development and function of organs such as the brain liver and kidney insulin like growth factor one igf one is mainly secreted by the liver as a result of stimulation by growth hormone hgh almost every cell in the human body is affected by igf one especially cells in muscle cartilage bone liver kidney nerves skin and lungs in addition to the insulin like effects igf one can also regulate cell growth and development especially in nerve cells as well as cellular dna synthesis igf ii is secreted by the brain kidney pancreas and muscle in mammals it is more specific in action than igf one in adult humans it is found at six zero zero times the concentration of insulin igf one and igf ii are regulated by a family of genes known as the igf binding proteins these proteins help to modulate igf action in complex ways that involve both inhibiting igf action by preventing binding to the igf one receptor as well as promoting igf action possibly through aiding in delivery to the receptor and increasing igf half life currently there are six characterized igf binding proteins igfbp one six there is currently significant data suggesting that igfbps play important roles in addition to their ability to regulate igfs studies of recent interest show that the igf axis play an important role in aging nematodes fruit flies and other organisms have an increased life span when the gene equivalent to the mammalian igf is knocked out clearly the igf insulin axis has an ancient evolutionary origin other studies are beginning to uncover the important role the igfs play in diseases such as cancer and diabetes showing for instance that igf one stimulates growth of both prostate and breast cancer cells one three researchers are not in complete agreement about the degree of cancer risk that igf one poses further work is required to determine the main receptors used by these growth factors to elicit their effects currently the igf s are known to bind the insulin receptor igf one receptor igf two receptor the insulin related receptor and possible other receptors igf one and igf two strongly bind to and activate the igf one receptor with weaker binding and action occurring through insulin receptors the igf two receptor only binds igf two and acts as a clearance receptor it activates no intracellular signalling pathways functioning only as an igf two sequestering agent and preventing igf two signalling igf one is

the greek word idi t s a private citizen individual from idios private it was originally used in the ancient greek city states to refer to people who were overly concerned with their own self interest and ignored the needs of the community these people were seen as having bad judgement in public and political matters over time the term idiot shifted away from its original connotation of selfishness and came to refer to individuals with overall bad judgement that is individuals who are stupid in modern english usage the terms idiot and idiocy describe an extreme folly or stupidity its symptoms foolish or stupid utterance or deed or in psychology the state or condition of an idiot i e profound mental retardation antiquity in athens an idiot s was a person who kept to himself by declining to take part in public life such as democratic city state government since such activities were considered honorable and could directly affect all citizens idiot became a term of derision see athenian

handicap in one nine th and early two zero th century medicine and psychology an idiot was a person with a very severe mental retardation or a very low iq level idiots were defined as people whose iq were below two zero with a standard deviation of one six in the current classification these people are now said to have profound mental retardation but the word idiot is no longer used as a scientific term use as an abuse in modern english and other languages idiot is also a derogatory term used to insult its use usually means you are stupid it s socially acceptable for example to refer to a group of drunken folks acting up in a bar as idiots paradoxically however idiot cannot easily be used to describe someone who is genuinely mentally retarded in the two one st century such use would be seen as insensitive hurtful or politically incorrect a select number of authors have used idiot characters in novels plays and poetry often these characters are used to highlight or indicate something else that is often these characters are an allegorical technique examplars of such usage are william faulkner s the sound and the fury and william wordsworth s the idiot boy idiot characters in literature are often confused with or subsumed within mad or lunatic characters the most common imbrication between these two categories of mental impairment occurs in the polemic surrounding edmund from shakespeare s king lear in dostoyevsky s novel the idiot the idiocy of the main character prince myshkin is attributed more to his honesty trustfulness kindness and humility than to his mental disability this somewhat parallels the use of the word idiot in colloquial russian to characterize the naive optimist and the do gooder other uses the idiot is a classic in world literature in

perhaps the least secret of all secret societies in the world described below most use refers to an alleged shadowy conspiratorial organization which controls world affairs behind the scenes usually a modern incarnation or continuation of the bavarian illuminati illuminati is sometimes used synonymously with new world order origins since illuminati literally means enlightened ones in latin it is natural that several unrelated historical groups have identified themselves as illuminati often this was due to claims of possessing gnostic texts or other arcane information not generally available the designation illuminati was in use from the one four th century by the brethren of the free spirit in the one five th century the name was adopted by other enthusiasts who claimed that the illuminating light came not by communication from an authoritative or secret source but from within as the result of exalted consciousness or enlightenment alumbrados of spain to the gnostic class belong the alumbrados of spain the historian marcelino men ndez y pelayo found the name as early as one four nine two in the form aluminados one four nine eight and traced the group to a gnostic origin he thought their views were promoted in spain through influences from italy one of their earliest leaders born in salamanca was a labourer s daughter known as la beata de piedrahita she came to the notice of the inquisition in one five one one by claiming to hold colloquies with jesus and the virgin mary some high patronage saved her from a rigorous denunciation men ndez pelayo los heterodoxos espa oles one eight eight one vol v ignatius loyola while studying at salamanca in one five two seven was brought before an ecclesiastical commission on a charge of sympathy with the alumbrados but escaped with an admonition others were not so fortunate in one five two nine a congregation of na ve adherents at toledo was subjected to whippings and imprisonment greater rigors followed and for about a century alleged connection with the alumbrados sent many to the inquisition especially at c rdoba illumin s of france the movement under the name of illumin s seems to have reached france from seville in one six two three and attained some following in picardy when joined one six three four by pierce guerin cur of saint georges de roye whose followers known as gurinets were suppressed in one six three five a century later another more obscure body of illumin s came to light in the south of france in one seven two two and appears to have lingered till one seven nine four having affinities with those known contemporaneously in britain as french prophets an offshoot of the camisards rosicrucians different from the llumin s were the rosicrucians who claimed to have originated in one four zero seven but rose to notice in one six one four when their main text fama fraternitatis appeared as a secret society they claimed to combine the possession of esoteric principles of religion with the mysteries of alchemy their positions are described in three anonymous treatises from one six one four mentioned in richard and giraud dictionnaire universel des sciences eccl siastiques paris one eight two five as well as in the confessio fraternitatis of one six one five rosicrucians also claimed heritage from the knights templar martinists later the title illuminati was applied to the french martinists which had been founded in one seven five four by martinez pasqualis and to their imitators the russian martinists headed about one seven nine zero by professor schwartz of moscow both were occultist cabalists and allegorists absorbing eclectic ideas from jakob boehme and emanuel swedenborg the bavarian illuminati history a movement of freethinkers that were the most radical offshoot of the enlightenment whose adherents were given the name illuminati but who called themselves perfectibilists was founded on may one one seven seven six by jesuit taught adam weishaupt d one eight three zero who was the first lay professor of canon law the group has also been called the illuminati order the order of the illuminati the ancient illuminated seers of bavaria and the bavarian illuminati in the conservative state of bavaria where the progressive and enlightened elector maximilian iii joseph von wittelsbach was succeeded one seven seven seven by his conservative heir karl theodor and which was dominated by the roman catholic church and the aristocracy such an organization did not last long before it was suppressed by the powers of the day in one seven eight four the bavarian government banned all secret societies including the illuminati and the freemasons the structure of the illuminati soon collapsed but while it was in existence many influential intellectuals and progressive politicians counted themselves as members its members were supposedly drawn primarily from masons and former masons and although some masons were known to be members there is no evidence that it was supported by freemasons the members pledged obedience to their superiors and were divided into three main classes the first known as the nursery encompassed the ascending degrees or offices of preparation novice minerval and illuminatus minor the second known as the masonry consisting of the ascending degrees of illuminatus major and illuminatus dirigens the latter also sometimes called scotch knight the third designated the mysteries was subdivided into the degrees of the lesser mysteries presbyter and regent and those of the greater mysteries magus and rex relations with masonic lodges were established at munich and freising in one seven eight zero the order had its branches in most countries of the european continent its members were reportedly around three zero zero zero four zero zero zero members in the span of one zero years the scheme had its attraction for literary men such as goethe and herder and even for the reigning dukes of gotha and weimar internal rupture preceded its downfall which was effected by an edict of the bavarian government in one seven eight five cultural effect the bavarian illuminati have cast a long shadow in popular history thanks to the writings of their opponents the lurid allegations of conspiracy that have colored the image of the freemasons have practically opaqued that of the illuminati in one seven nine seven abb augustin barru l published memoirs illustrating the history of jacobinism outlining a vivid conspiracy theory involving the knights templar the rosicrucians the jacobins and the illuminati a scottish mason and professor of natural history named john robison started to publish proofs of a conspiracy against all the religions and governments of europe in one seven nine eight robison claimed to present evidence of an illuminati conspiracy striving to replace all religions with humanism and all nations with a single world government more recently antony c sutton suggested that the secret society skull and bones was founded as the american branch of the illuminati others think scroll and key had illuminati origins as well writer robert gillette claimed that these illuminati ultimately intend to establish a world government through assassination bribery blackmail the control of banks and other financial powers the infiltration of governments mind control and by causing wars and revolution to move their own people into higher positions in the political hierarchy thomas jefferson on the other hand claimed they intended to spread information and the principles of true morality he attributed the secrecy of the illuminati to what he called the tyranny of a despot and priests both seem to agree that the enemies of the illuminati were the monarchs of europe and the church barru l claimed that the french revolution one seven eight nine was engineered and controlled by the illuminati through the jacobins and later conspiracy theorists have also claimed their responsibility for the russian revolution one nine one seven although the order was officially shut down in one seven nine zero few historians give credence to these views they regard such claims as the products of over fertile imaginations several sources suggest that the bavarian illuminati survived and perhaps even exists today conspiracy theorists highlight the link between the illuminati and freemasonry it is also suggested that the united states founding fathers some being freemasons were rife with corruption from the illuminati often the symbol of the all seeing pyramid in the great seal of the united states is cited as an example of the illuminati s ever present watchful eye over americans very little reliable evidence can be found to suggest that weishaupt s group survived into the one nine th century however several groups have since used the name illuminati to found their own rites claiming to be the illuminati such groups include the grand lodge rockefeller of david goldman usa orden illuminati of gabriel l pez de rojas spain and the illuminati order of solomon tulbure usa in one nine nine five gabriel l pez de rojas founded illuminati order in barcelona spain elaborating the operative rite of the illuminati of bavaria this rite is based on the rite of the illuminati and high degrees of scottish rite of three three degrees the system of its illuminati grand master gabriel l pez de rojas is the redism this system is based on the lemma homo est deus or man is god groups describing themselves as illuminati say they have members and chapters lodges throughout the world about the time that the illuminati were outlawed in bavaria the roman catholic church prohibited its members from joining masonic lodges on pain of excommunication this was done as a general edict since the church believed many lodges to have been infiltrated and subverted by the illuminati but was not able to accurately ascertain which ones this rule was relaxed only in the

choice voting rcv or the hare system is a voting system normally used for single winner elections utilizing a ranked ballot in australia and new zealand it is referred to as preferential voting although this term may be misleading because it is not the only preferential voting system the term instant runoff refers to the way in which irv ballots are tabulated as the winner is determined similarly to holding a series of runoff elections with vote choices implied from the alternative preferences listed on the ballot instant runoff voting is mathematically equivalent to the single transferable vote stv method when there is only a single winner and is therefore sometimes referred to as stv irv was first used in australia by the self governing colony of queensland in one eight nine three the system gradually spread to other parts of australia and has been used to elect the australian house of representatives since one nine one nine irv is also used to elect the president of ireland the papua new guinea national parliament and the fijian house of representatives history and usage instant runoff voting was invented around one eight seven zero by american architect william robert ware ware was not a mathematician thus never subjected his election method to any rigorous analysis he evidently based irv on the single winner outcome of the single transferable vote or stv developed in one eight five five originally by carl andrae in denmark it was introduced into england in one eight five seven by the barrister thomas hare where it earned public praise from john stuart mill an english philosopher member of parliament and employee of the east india company current usage irv is used in australia for elections to the federal house of representatives for the legislative assemblies lower houses of all states and territories except tasmania and the australian capital territory which use regional multi member constituencies it is also used for the legislative councils upper houses of tasmania and victoria although the latter will switch to the multi member variant from two zero zero six in the pacific irv is used for the fijian house of representatives papua new guinea has also decided to adopt it for future elections starting in two zero zero seven the fijian system has been modified to allow for both default preferences specified by the political party or candidate and custom preferences specified by the voter each political party or candidate ranks all other candidates according to its own preference voters who are happy with that need only to vote for their own preferred candidate whose preferences will automatically be transferred according to the ranking specified by the candidate voters who disagree with the ranking however may opt to rank the candidates according to their own preferences in the last election however only about a tenth of all voters did so the ballot paper is divided by a thick black line with boxes above for the default options and below for customized preferences the countries mentioned above all use irv for some or all of their municipal elections starting in two zero zero four some municipal areas in new zealand also adopted irv to elect mayors and stv to elect councilors political parties cooperatives and other private groups also use stv and or irv a voting method similar to irv known as plurality vote with elimination is used to select the winning bid of both the summer and winter olympics in the international olympic committee see table of voting systems by nation adoption in the united

universities including most notably the asuc at the university of california berkeley notable supporters include republican u s senator john mccain two zero zero four democratic presidential primary election candidates howard dean and dennis kucinich and consumer advocate ralph nader the system is favored by the united states green party and the united states libertarian party as a solution to the spoiler effect third party sympathizers suffer from under plurality voting i e voters are forced to vote tactically to defeat the candidate they most dislike rather than for their own preferred candidate irv was adopted for mayoral races in ann arbor michigan in one nine seven five after a successful ballot initiative sponsored by the local left wing human rights party however the process was used only for the one nine seven six mayoral election this issue rose to attention in the united states in the two zero zero zero election supporters of ralph nader who nevertheless preferred democrat al gore to republican george w bush found themselves caught in a dilemma they could vote for nader and risk gore losing to bush or they could vote for gore just to make sure that bush is defeated it has been argued that bush won solely due to the spoiler effect of nader supporters in either florida or in new hampshire in march two zero zero two an initiative backed by the center for

youthvote an election held throughout san francisco s public schools which elected the sf school board s student delegate after that it was used in the november two zero zero four supervisoral races note the san francisco department of elections prefers the term ranked choice voting because the word instant might create an expectation that final results will be available immediately after the polls close on election night the new system did not work as well as was hoped due to software and logistical difficulties the results took several days to produce definitive results voters in

vermont voted to amend their city charter to use instant runoff voting in september two zero zero three an amendment to the california state constitution was proposed sca one four with wide ranging goals of election reform including ranked choice voting for statewide offices in order to increase awareness of the voting method and to demonstrate it in a real world situation the independence party of minnesota tested irv by using it in a straw poll during the two zero zero four minnesota caucuses results favored john edwards also the green party of minnesota conducts an annual poll of minnesota state fair attendees where each person ranks their preferences for fair food to better understand how irv works in a real world situation activists in the state of washington have been urging adoption of instant runoff voting there for several years an initiative seeking ballot access in two zero zero five failed to garner enough signatures the city of vancouver washington has voted to adopt instant runoff voting but the state legislature has yet to enact enabling legislation in the november eight two zero zero five election the voters in takoma park maryland adopted irv on a ballot item it was voted for by eight four of the one five eight two voters adoption in canada historical use of irv in british columbia irv under the name preferential ballot or elimination ballot was applied in british columbia for the one nine five two and one nine five three elections brought in by the old guard parties liberals and conservatives to try to foil the possibility of a left wing government under the co operative commonwealth federation or ccf the predecessor to today s new democratic party irv backfired on those who had brought it in with ccf voters marking an obscure also ran party s outspoken but otherwise unknown leader and the fringe social credit movement was coalesced into a governing caucus overnight in an uneasy coalition between the social credit party and the rumps of the old guard parties the coalition dissolved within the year and new elections using the irv system were held that secured social credit a comfortable majority one of the now secure new premier s acts after this second election was to return the province to first past the post voting so as to remove any future risk to his own governance by the unknown factors of the preferential choice ballot how irv works voting each voter ranks at least one candidate in order of preference in most australian elections voters are required to rank all candidates in other elections votes may be truncated for example if the voter only ranks his first five choices an example of truncated voting occurs in elections for the new south wales legislative assembly in these elections a valid vote requires the voter to choose only one candidate but the voter also has the choice of indicating an order of preference for as many candidates as they like if a voter s choices are eliminated from the count the vote is said to be exhausted this is commonly known as optional preferential voting counting the votes first choices are tallied if no candidate has the support of a majority of voters the candidate with the least support is eliminated a second round of counting takes place with the votes of supporters of the eliminated candidate now counting for their second choice candidate after a candidate is eliminated he or she may not receive any more votes this process of counting and eliminating is repeated until one candidate has over half the votes this is equivalent to continuing until there is only one candidate left however it is possible with voter truncation for the process to continue until there is only one candidate left who does not end up with more than half the votes an example chattanooga having the smallest vote is eliminated in the first round all of the votes for chattanooga have knoxville as a second choice so they are transferred to knoxville nashville now has the smallest vote so it is eliminated the votes for nashville have chattanooga as a second choice but as chattanooga has been eliminated they instead transfer to their third choice knoxville knoxville now has five eight of the vote and it is the winner in a real election of course voters would show greater variation in the rankings they cast which could influence the result however the result of knoxville winning shows that in this case a capital which is the last choice of four two of the state s population can win some would say that this is an undesirable result the reason for this result is that the preferences of those who voted for memphis are not counted beyond their first choice because memphis isn t eliminated until the last round in schulze method another ranked choice voting method all preferences are counted and nashville a compromise city toward the geographic center of the state would win to voters both methods are the same as the ballot is identical in most ranked choice voting methods the method of counting and in this case the outcome of the votes differs special cases of irv eliminations instant runoff voting as an ideal does not explicitly define how to handle special cases such as ties and different rules can be considered a good irv election must define rules to handle these cases before the votes are cast this is because there are cases where one set of rules will select a winner different from another set of rules and the set of rules used may affect how the voters cast their ballots especially when performing irv counts on smaller elections there can be frequent last place ties that prevent clear bottom elimination here are some approaches to consider individually and combined the first class of rules allows many candidates to be eliminated at the first count regardless of actual ties these are practical rules before the first round that reward stronger candidates among the full set of competition such rules won t likely affect the winner but they will reduce the number of elimination rounds and thus the number of opportunities for ties to develop a second class of rules consider actual ties that can t be avoided consider multicandidate elimination of weak candidates as the first step candidate count define a maximum number of candidates that can survive the first round example top two vote minimum define a minimum vote threshold five vote for example and eliminate all weaker candidates together requires limitations for rule to apply percent minimum define a minimum percent vote threshold five for example and eliminate all weaker candidates together again requires limitations for application percent retention define a minimum percent of votes by top candidates to be retained example retain the top set of candidates who combined control five zero of the vote tie breaking rules logic if the tied candidates combined have fewer votes than the next highest candidate the entire tied set can be eliminated at once logically deterministic but may not apply first round eliminate the candidate in the tie with the lowest number of votes at the earliest stage in the count at which the candidates in question had an unequal number of votes in effect this means the candidate with the lowest number of first preference votes except in the unlikely circumstance that the same candidates are tied both in the round when one has to be eliminated and in the first round traditional rule violates purity of one person one vote principle all eliminate all tied candidates at once good for weak candidates with less than five of votes but can lead to strategic nominations which cause irv implementations using this method to not be spoiler proof random eliminate one randomly to break the tie order if the order of the candidates on the ballot paper has been determined by lot then ties can be eliminated by choosing say the top candidate random voter hierarchy rvh randomly determine a strict ordering of the candidates and when selecting a candidate to eliminate pick one based on this strict ordering similar to random elimination but with many nice properties not found with random elimination assessing irv comparison of irv to plurality voting there are two major differences between irv and plurality voting voters use preferential voting a ranked ballot indicating numerically the order of their preference for candidates the intent of irv is for the winning candidate to be one that receives absolute majority support of voters compared to the requirement for only simple majority support in a plurality system comparison of irv to normal runoff voting advantages of instant runoff ballot irv more positive candidates are discouraged from negative campaigning a winning candidate will usually need first second and lower ranked preferences to win and can t safely afford to make enemies with no second chance vote avoids some fracturing of political interests in a runoff a major political interest may fracture into a variety of parties with its vote splitting in the first ballot such that all those parties candidates are eliminated in the first ballot in the two zero zero two french presidential election for example the minority front national candidate won through to the final ballot because the more numerous socialist vote was split among different parties this can also be considered as a spoiler effect in the first round vote saves money irv spares the cost of having run off elections advantages of sequential balloting runoff voting easier to vote a runoff allows voters and factions to refocus their attention on remaining candidates in each round in irv voters must make careful choices among a large set of candidates in one ballot and may not have enough information to make informed rankings among the competitive candidates less confusion on voters part many voters don t follow races closely they know who their first choice is but examining the differences between all the other candidates they believe requires too much time and effort less critical examination of candidates by one another candidates are discouraged from criticizing one another as a candidate may need first second and lower ranked preferences to win and therefore a candidate can t make enemies with another candidate by criticizing him or her chance for appeal candidates that were eliminated are given another chance to endorse and remaining candidates have another chance to court voters supporting the eliminated candidates presentation of minor parties in a runoff minor parties stand on their own merits in the first round of voting under the single event irv interest in the minor parties only focuses on how they recommend their supporters cast their preferences between the major parties the electoral system configures minor parties as preference cows in a runoff minor parties have the power to recommend second preferences in the final round effect on parties and candidates unlike runoff voting however there are no chances to deal in between rounds change voters minds or gain support of the other candidates giving them only one chance to do so instant runoff voting encourages candidates to balance earning core support through winning first choice support and earning broad support through winning the second and third preferences of other candidates core supporters as with first past the post however any block of more than half the voters can elect a candidate regardless of the opinion of the rest of the voters this is considered a weakness by the advocates of a more deliberative democracy who point to the french system of presidential election where such between round dealings are heavily exploited and useful they say to draw together a very factionalized electorate however critics of the french runoff system point to the dreaded votez escroc pas facho vote for the crook not the fascist phenomenon which they believe awarded chirac an undeserved landslide victory in two zero zero two the australian system also allows minority parties to have key planks of their platforms included in those of the major parties by means of so called preference deals this is seen as legitimate political activity if enough people care about for instance green party issues that that party s second preference can swing the vote then it is fair enough that it have some limited say in policy another advantage of runoff voting is that it usually allows a protest vote to be made without penalty a person voting for a minority party does not throw his vote away as with first past the post systems so allowing the electorate to send clear signals to the major parties criteria passed there are several voting system criteria that have been defined by political scientists for assessment of voting systems irv meets the majority criterion the mutual majority criterion the condorcet loser criterion and depending on the used tie breaker method the independence of clones criterion irv is invulnerable to the burying strategy criteria failed irv does not pass the monotonicity criterion the consistency criterion the condorcet criterion the summability criterion the participation criterion reversal symmetry or the independence of irrelevant alternatives criterion according to arrow s theorem no voting system meets all of a certain set of criteria when there are three or more choices these theoretical objections may correspond with practical failures of irv discussed below the first two compromise and push over are types of tactical voting where voters vote insincerely to increase the likelihood of a favored outcome some argue that condorcet methods and approval voting are better at selecting compromise candidates and at reducing the spoiler effect yet condorcet methods may not yield a winner see condorcet paradox in which case one must resort to another voting method i e borda count instant runoff or restrict the field of candidates see condorcet method resolving circular ambiguities compromise assume the earlier tennessee example the voters from memphis can get a better result by compromising they can rank nashville over memphis and thus ensure that nashville their second choice will win rather than knoxville their last choice alternatively if the voters from memphis do not vote tactically perhaps because they think they have a chance of winning outright perhaps because they dislike insincerity etc voters from nashville can improve their result by compromising and ranking chattanooga over nashville this would allow chattanooga to defeat knoxville in the first round and go on to become eventual winner a better result for nashville voters than a knoxville win nearly all voting methods produce an incentive to use the compromising strategy in some scenarios i e in scenarios where there is no condorcet winner however irv clearly has more frequent compromising incentive than condorcet methods in that it sometimes produces a compromising incentive even when there is a condorcet winner this problem is exacerbated in versions of irv that do not allow equal rankings if voters do choose to compromise in a version of irv that does not allow equal rankings they will have to so by ranking a more preferred candidate below a less preferred candidate which is a more severe distortion of their sincere preferences than ranking them equally push over irv is unusual in that it fails the monotonicity criterion the implication of this is that it is vulnerable to the push over strategy tactical voters can benefit by raising push overs candidates unlikely to win above their real favorite causing a stronger opponent to their favorite to be eliminated early leaving only the push over to contend with their favorite in the last round this strategy typically requires a great deal of coordination and typically entails a substantial risk of backfire thus some argue that irv s vulnerability to the strategy will rarely or never manifest in practice failure to pick a compromise candidate imagine that candidates are located along a one dimensional ideological spectrum and that the center of the spectrum is defined by the median voter irv does not reliably choose the option closest to the center of the spectrum thus it can be argued that irv is less apt at choosing compromise candidates than for example the condorcet methods and more likely to choose an ideologically polar candidate for example this failure can occur in a three choice election where parties a and c are bitterly opposed and party b is first choice for a minority but tolerable for a large majority for a real life example consider the one seven th century europe struggle over government enforced catholicism versus government enforced protestantism with freedom of private worship as the compromise b imagine that votes are cast as follows in irv the compromise choice b is eliminated immediately choice c is elected arguably giving severely lower total satisfaction amongst voters than choice b who is preferred by a large majority to a and who is also preferred by a large majority to c logistical issues irv fails the summability criterion which means that the results for a particular precinct cannot be conveniently summarized for transfer to the central tally location instead the precincts must send a total record of every ordering of the candidates made by a voter times the frequency of that ordering the unwieldiness of this data may prolong the counting procedure provide more opportunities for undetected tampering than in summable methods and make recounts more costly if counting takes place in several places for a single irv election as in australia these counting centers must be connected by a securely authenticated channel historically the telegraph was used to inform them which candidate has come last and should be dropped logistical issues in australia house of representatives initially in australia ballots are counted at the booth level with first preference results reported to the divisional returning officer and then to the national tally room if it is clear who the two leading candidates will be a notional distribution of the preferences of the minor candidates may be made postal and absentee ballots are of course yet to be processed that takes another week or two over the next few weeks ballots and matching documentation are concentrated in the offices of the divisional returning officer where a actual distribution of preferences is made this may be done by physically moving the ballots around or by entering ballot data into a suitable computer if a candidate wins five one of first preferences a distribution of minor party preferences is strictly speaking not necessary however the law now allows that such preferences be distributed to see what the two party preferred vote actually is federal elections are conducted by the australian electoral commission who employ all the workers at all the booths to a common standard of neutrality and efficiency candidates may appoint scrutineers to watch but not touch what is

islam is not only a religion but also a political system that can govern the legal economic and social imperatives of the state islamist movements seek to re shape the state by implementing a conservative formulation of sharia islamists regard themselves as muslims rather than islamists while moderate muslims and liberal movements within islam reject this notion for some islamism exhibits triumphalism definition in the aftermath of the september one one two zero zero one attacks islamist movements along with other political movements inspired by islam gained increased attention in the western media although the groups and individuals representing these are not mutually exclusive within academia each term does have a distinct definition some islamist groups have been implicated in terrorism and have become targets in the war on terrorism however it is important to keep in mind that this difference between islam and islamism is not as sharp clear or distinct for many followers of islam as it has been made in recent years become for many english speaking non muslims or western academics for example most followers of islam would consider themselves fundamentalists insofar as believing in islam means believing in its fundamentals similarly islam also promotes a vision of society influenced by the tenets of the religion in much the same way that christianity buddhism and other religions advocate not just personal but also social changes most islamist literature deals not with other religions but with political ideologies since islamists were reacting against competing movements such as communism widespread poverty and consequent class tensions led to widespread socialist movements all over the muslim world during the two zero th century but the collapse of the soviet union ultimately reduced the influence of leftist ideologies islamism has emerged as the remaining revolutionary ideology in muslim societies gaining much support through rising anti western sentiment due to control of the west bank and gaza strip by israel governments based on secular arab nationalism have found themselves facing economic stagnation and disorder some muslims place the blame for these flaws in muslim societies on the influx of foreign ideas a return to the principles of islam is seen as the natural cure a persistent islamist theme is that muslims are persecuted by the west and other foreigners in this context islamist ideas developed in several different settings some including robert spencer and andrew bostom specialists on islam reject the notion of islamist as separate from islam arguing that the elements that are identified as islamist are actually central to islam islam is not merely a religion it is a way of life for all muslims just as it gives laws what is forbidden to eat it gives laws on crimes that are forbidden to do and there are punishments for not following those this is generally what shari ah islamic law is muslims do not find anything wrong in trying to establish an islamic state that takes the shari ah as law if the majority of that country s population are themselves muslim and so would find no objection to their state law being in accordance with their belief this seem to mirror what islamists would like so muslims do not disagree with them on this notion rather they agree with them history although islamic states based on shari a law have existed since the earliest days of islam islamism refers to modern movements that developed during the twentieth century in reaction to several forces following world war i the dissolution of the ottoman empire and the subsequent dissolution of the caliphate by mustafa kemal atat rk founder of turkey some muslims perceived that islam was in retreat and felt that western ideas were spreading throughout muslim society along with the influence of western nations during the one nine six zero s the predominant ideology within the arab world was pan arabism which deemphasized religion and emphasized the creation of a socialist secular state based on arab nationalism rather than islam the deobandi movement in india the deobandi movement developed as a reaction to british actions against muslims and the influence of sayed ahmad khan who advocated the reform and modernization of islam named after the town of deoband where it originated the movement was built around islamic schools principally darul uloom and taught an interpretation of islam that encouraged the subservience of women discouraged the use of many forms of technology and entertainment and believed that only revealed or god inspired knowledge rather than human knowledge should be followed these however were against many muslim teachings e g women were in fact to be held in high esteem and held rights over men not vice versa though the deobandi philosophy is puritanical and wishes to remove non muslim i e hindu or western influence from muslim societies it was not especially violent or proselytising confining its activity mostly to the establishment of madrassas or muslim religious schools they are a major sector of muslims in the region the followers of sayed ahmad khan being a significant minority the taliban movement in afghanistan was a product of the deobandi philosophy and the madarassas sayyid abul ala maududi sayyid abul ala maududi was an important early twentieth century figure in india then after independence from britain in pakistan strongly influenced by deobandi ideology he advocated the creation of an islamic state governed by sharia islamic law as interpreted by shura councils maududi founded the jamaat e islami in one nine four one and remained at its head until one nine seven two his extremely influential book towards understanding islam risalat diniyat in arabic placed islam in modern context and enabled not only conservative ulema but liberal modernizers such as al faruqi whose islamization of knowledge carried forward some of maududi s key principles chief among these was the basic compatibility of islam with an ethical scientific view quoting from maududi s own work everything in the universe is muslim for it obeys god by submission to his laws for his entire life from the embryonic stage to the body s dissolution into dust after death every tissue of his muscles and every limb of his body follows the course prescribed by god s law his very tongue which on account of his ignorance advocates the denial of god or professes multiple deities is in its very nature muslim the man who denies god is called kafir concealer because he conceals by his disbelief what is inherent in his nature and embalmed in his own soul his whole body functions in obedience to that instinct reality becomes estranged from him and he gropes in the dark the muslim brotherhood maududi s ideas were a strong influence on sayyed qutb in egypt qutb was one of the key philosophers in the muslim brotherhood movement after the assassination of its founder in one nine four nine the brotherhood was established in ismailiyah egypt in one nine two eight and was banned but still exists following confrontations with egyptian president gamal abdul nasser who jailed qutb and thousands of others for years the muslim brotherhood founded by hasan al banna advocated a return to sharia because of what they perceived as the inability of western values to secure harmony and prosperity for muslims since only divine guidance could lead humans to peace justice and prosperity it followed that muslims should eschew man made systems of governance and live according to divinely inspired sharia the qur an is our constitution the brotherhood also advocated jihad against the european colonial powers particularly the british and the french and their allies who ruled over virtually all of the muslim world during al banna s and much of qutb s life time islamic jihad movements while qutb s ideas became increasingly radical during his imprisonment prior to his execution in one nine six six the leadership of the brotherhood led by hasan al hudaybi remained moderate and interested in political negotiation and activism fringe or splinter movements however did develop and pursued a more radical direction perhaps inspired by final writings of qutb in the mid one nine six zero s e g milestones by the one nine seven zero s the brotherhood renounced violence as a means to their goals the path of violence and military struggle was however taken up by such movements as the egyptian islamic jihad organisation responsible for the assassination of anwar sadat in one nine eight one unlike earlier anti colonial movements egyptian islamic jihad focused its efforts on apostate leaders of muslim states or those leaders who held secular leanings or introduced or promoted western foreign ideas and practices into islamic societies their views were outlined in a pamphlet written by muhammad abd al salaam farag in which he states there is no doubt that the first battlefield for jihad is the extermination of these infidel leaders and to replace them by a complete islamic order it is important to note that jihad means struggle and comes in many forms not just military eg not giving in to temptation is a struggle is a jihad another islamic jihad group emerged in palestine as an offshoot of the egyptian group and began militant activity against the state of israel and consistently opposed itself to the policies of the secular palestine liberation organization plo and yasser arafat wahhabism another influential strain of islamist thought came from the wahhabi movement in saudi arabia the wahhabists who emerged in the one eight th century led by muhammad ibn abd al wahhab also believed that it was necessary to live according to the strict dictates of islam which they interpreted to mean living in the manner that the prophet muhammad and his followers had lived in during the seventh century in medina consequently they were opposed to many innovations developed since that time including the minaret marked graves and later television and radios the wahhabis also considered those muslims who violated their strict interpretation to be heretics and thus used violence against other muslims when king abdul aziz al saud founded saudi arabia he brought the wahhabists into power with him with saud s rise to prominence wahhabism spread especially following the one nine seven three oil embargo and the glut of oil wealth that resulted for saudi arabia the wahhabists were proselytizers and made use of their wealth to spread their interpretation of islam recent history islamism went through its major political and philosophical developments in the early part of the twentieth century but it was not until the one nine eight zero s that it became active in an international arena and rose to great prominence in the one nine nine zero s the reasons for the rise of islamism during this period are still disputed the ideologies that had dominated the middle east since decolonization such as ba athism arab socialism and arab nationalism had by one nine eight zero failed to attain the economic and political goals expected of them by the late one nine eight zero s the distinct shi ite version of political islam had been drained of its vigour in the iran iraq war during the conflict against the soviet union in afghanistan many islamists came together to fight what they saw as an atheist invading force and were heavily funded by the united states in pakistan military dictators brought into power through coups especially zia ul haq exploited islamist sentiments to consolidate their power bringing islamist political parties into prominence and all but destroying the traditional secularism that stemmed from the secular stance of the muslim league and its leader mohammad ali jinnah founder of pakistan in his book jihad the trail of political islam gilles kepel argues that the central importance of islamism in the one nine nine zero s was a product of the gulf war prior to one nine nine zero organized political islam had been mostly associated with saudi arabia a nation founded on wahhabism and an ally of islamist groups in egypt and in afghanistan saudi arabia as a close ally of the west and with a strong interest in regional stability played an important restraining role on islamist groups the shi ite clerics in iran had long argued that saudi arabia was an apostate state a puppet of the west that espoused a corrupted islam during the one nine eight zero s these accusations had little effect largely because of their shi ite origin however kepel argues that when saddam hussein turned on his former allies he embraced this rhetoric arguing that saudi arabia had betrayed its duty to protect the holiest sites of islam kepel states that saddam hussein embraced islamic rhetoric and trappings and tried to draw leading scholars and activists to his camp some of the main islamist groups remained loyal to saudi arabia but a number such as parts of the muslim brotherhood and afghani mujahideen aligned themselves with saddam far more groups declared themselves neutral in the struggle according to kepel the rapid defeat of saddam did not end this rift as saddam had likely predicted saudi arabia had found itself in a severe dilemma the only way to counter the iraqi threat was to seek help from the west which would immediately confirm the iraqi allegations of saudi arabia being a friend to the west to ensure the regime s survival saudi arabia accepted a massive western presence in the country and de facto cooperation with israel causing great offence to many in islamist circles after the war saudi arabia launched a two pronged strategy to restore its security and leadership in islamist circles those islamist groups who refused to return under the saudi umbrella were persecuted and any islamists who had criticized saudi regime were arrested or forced into exile with most going to london at the same time saudi oil money began to flow freely to those islamist groups who continued to work with the kingdom islamist madrassas around the world saw their funding greatly increased more covertly saudi money began to fund more violent islamist groups in areas such as bosnia and the former soviet union saudi arabia s western allies mostly looked the other way seeing the survival of their crucial ally as more important than the problem of more money and resources flowing to islamist groups in the one nine nine zero s islamist conflicts erupted around the world in areas such as algeria the palestinian territories sudan and nigeria in one nine nine five a series of terrorist attacks were launched against france the most important development was the rise to power of the deobandi taliban in afghanistan in one nine nine six in the taliban ruled afghanistan a number of anti saudi and anti western islamist groups found refuge significantly osama bin laden a wealthy saudi influenced by wahhabism and the writings of sayed qutb joined forces with the egyptian islamic jihad under ayman al zawahiri to form what is now called al qaeda a considerable effort has been made to fight western targets especially the united states the united states in particular was made a subject of islamist ire because of its support for israel its presence on saudi arabian soil what islamists regard as its aggression against muslims in iraq and its support of the regimes islamists oppose in addition some islamists have concentrated their activity against israel and nearly all islamists view israel with hostility osama bin laden at least believes that this is of necessity due to historical conflict between muslims and jews and considers there to be a jewish american alliance against islam there is some debate as to how influential islamist movements remain some scholars assert that islamism is a fringe movement that is dying following the clear failures of islamist regimes like the regime in sudan the wahhabist saudi regime and the deobandi taliban to improve the lot of muslims however others e g ahmed rashid feel that the islamists still command considerable support and cite the fact that islamists in pakistan and egypt regularly poll one zero to three zero percent in electoral polls which many believe are rigged against them an alternative direction has been taken by many islamists in turkey where the islamist movement split into reformist and traditionalist wings in two zero zero one the reformists formed the moderate islamist justice and development party ak party which gained an overall majority in the turkish parliament in two zero zero two and has sought to balance islamic values with the requirements of a secular and democratic political system some in the justice and development party see the christian democrat parties of western europe as a model which has led some to question whether it is a genuinely islamist movement islamism and modern political theory the foundation of modern islamist thought is the many centuries of islamic theology and political science but the development of modern islamism was also both a reaction to and influenced by the other ideologies of the modern world modern islamism began in the colonial period and it was overtly anti imperialist it was also opposed to the local elites who wanted independence but who also supported adopting western liberal ideals writers like the egyptian sayyid qutb and the pakistani sayyid abul ala maududi saw western style individualism as counter to centuries of tradition and also as inevitably leading to a debauched and licentious society in the years after independence the most important ideological current in the muslim world was socialism and communism this influenced islamism in two ways much islamist thought and writing during this era was directly addressed to countering marxism for instance muhammad baqir al sadr s main works are detailed critiques of marxism paying much less attention to capitalism and liberalism another option was to try and integrate socialism and islamism this was most notably done by ali shariati at several points islamist and leftist groups found common cause such as during the early stages of the iranian revolution and several organizations such as the islamic socialist front in syria were both overtly marxist and overtly islamist while most islamists reject marxism the influence of socialist ideologies during the formative period of modern islamism means that islamist works continue to be infused with marxist language and concepts for instance qutb s view of an elite vanguard to lead an islamic revolution is borrowed directly from lenin s vanguard of the proletariat during the one nine three zero s a number of fascistic groups arose in the middle east some such as the ssnp and the kataeb party were mostly supported by christians and other minority groups others like the egyptian misr al fatat were mainly sunni arab the fascist method of seizing power did inspire islamist hassan al banna who founded organizations directly based on the brownshirts and blackshirts to try and seize power this method proved ineffective and since then most islamists have used the cell based structure commonly used by leftist groups ideologically there is little evidence that fascism had much influence on the development of islamism the far right french doctor alexis carrel had an important influence on qutb s thought and the well read qutb also seems to have had a passing knowledge of mein kampf several islamist groups have embraced nazi like anti semitism as an outgrowth of islamist anti zionism several authors among which daniel pipes and michael ledeen have prominently equated islamism to fascism and coined the word islamofascism cavelos and laidi state in isbn zero four one five one six seven one seven five a world without meaning that islamism shares more characteristics with fascism than with communism in that it does not have a definite progress belief which communism has and that three characteristics are shared by islamism communism and fascism a totalitarian political claim a global discourse about society in which the theme of exclusion is central and a political and social apparatus which respond to the demands of disadvantageous groups the most direct western parallel to islamism is however not fascism but dominionism put in place in the past such as during the protectorate of oliver cromwell

politics instructional theory is a discipline that focuses on how to structure material for promoting the education of humans particularly youth originating in the united states in the late one nine seven zero s instructional theory is typically divided into two categories the cognitive and behaviorist schools of thought instructional theory was spawned off the one nine five six work of benjamin bloom a university of chicago professor and the results of his taxonomy of education objectives one of the first modern codifications of the learning process one of the first instructional theorists was robert m gagne who in one nine six five published conditions of learning for the florida state university s department of educational research renowned psychologist b f skinner s theories of behavior were highly influential on instructional theorists because their hypotheses can be tested fairly easily with the scientific process it is more difficult to demonstrate cognitive learning results paulo freire s pedagogy of the oppressed first published in english in one nine six eight had a broad influence over a generation of american educators with his critique of various banking models of education and analysis of the teacher student relationship in the context of e learning a major discussion in instructional theory is the potential of learning objects to structure and deliver content a stand alone educational animation is an example of a learning object that can be re used as the basis for different learning experiences there are currently many groups trying to set standards for the development and implementation of learning objects at the forefront of the standards groups is the department of defense s advanced distributed learning initiative with its scorm

unicellular algae that exist in freshwater pond water however in formal classification microorganism called infusoria belongs to kingdom animalia phylum protozoa class ciliates infusoria aquarium use infusoria is used by owners of aquariums to feed fish fry gourami fry and tadpoles being just two examples which will require this food to survive the first few days however there is usually not enough infusoria in the average aquarium tank to feed the newly hatched animals to make infusoria you take a handful of hay or dry leaves and place it into a jar fill the jar with water from your tank or a pool of water leave in the sun for a few days when the water just starts to get cloudy the infusoria has sufficient bacteria to feed upon once the water begins to clear again an appropriate

cited as iso iec eight eight five nine one or less formally as latin one is part one of iso iec eight eight five nine a standard character encoding of the latin alphabet it was originally developed by the iso but later jointly maintained by the iso and the iec the standard when supplemented with additional character assignments is the basis of two widely used character maps known as iso eight eight

all maintenance of iso eight eight five nine including iso eight eight five nine one in order to concentrate on the universal character set and unicode in computing applications encodings that provide full ucs support such as utf eight and utf one six are finding increasing favor over encodings based on iso eight eight five nine one coverage iso eight eight five nine one encodes what it refers to as latin alphabet no one consisting of one nine one characters from the latin script each character is encoded as a single eight bit code value these code values can be used in almost any data

manufacturers association and published along with iso eight eight five nine two iso eight eight five nine three and iso eight eight five nine four as part of the specification ecma nine four by which name it is still sometimes known relationship to iso iec eight eight five nine one five although iso iec eight eight five nine one has enough characters for most french text it is missing a few less common letters it is also missing a single glyph representation for the letter two finnish letters used for transcription of some foreign names and in a few loanwords typographic quotation marks and dashes and common symbols such as the euro symbol and dagger in order to provide some of these characters iso iec eight eight five nine one five was developed as an update of iso iec eight eight five

czyborra s history of iso character sets iso eight eight five nine iec standards iso eight eight five nine more formally iso iec eight eight five nine is a joint iso and iec standard for eight bit character encodings for use by computers the standard is divided into numbered separately published parts such as iso iec eight eight five nine one iso iec eight eight five nine two etc each of which may be informally referred to as a standard in and of itself there are currently one five parts introduction while the bit patterns of the nine five printable ascii characters are sufficient to exchange information in modern english most other languages that use the roman alphabet need additional symbols not covered by ascii such as german spanish and swedish and other nordic languages iso eight eight five nine sought to remedy this problem by utilizing the eighth bit in an eight bit byte in order to allow positions for another one two eight characters this bit was previously used for data transmission protocol information or was left unused however more characters were needed than could fit in a single eight bit character encoding so several mappings were developed including at least one zero just to cover the latin script the iso eight eight five nine n encodings only contain printable characters and were designed to be used in conjunction with control characters mapped to the unassigned bytes to this end a series of encodings registered with the iana add the c zero control set control characters mapped to bytes zero to three one from iso six four six and the c one control set control characters mapped to bytes one two seven to one five nine from iso six four two nine resulting in full eight bit character maps with most if not all bytes assigned these sets have iso eight eight five nine n as their preferred mime name or in cases where a preferred mime name isn t specified their canonical name many people use the terms iso eight eight five nine n and iso eight eight five nine n interchangeably iso eight eight five nine one one did not get such a charset assigned presumablly because it was almost identical to tis six two zero characters the iso eight eight five nine standard is designed for reliable information exchange not typography the standard omits symbols needed for high quality typography such as optional ligatures curly quotation marks dashes etc as a result high quality typesetting systems often use proprietary or idiosyncratic extensions on top of the ascii and iso eight eight five nine standards or use unicode instead as a rule of thumb if a character or symbol was not already part of a widely used data processing character set and was also not usually provided on typewriter keyboards for a national language it didn t get in hence the directional double quotation marks and used for some european languages were included but not the directional double quotation marks and used for english and some other languages french didn t get its and ligatures because they could be typed as oe needed for all caps text was left out as well these characters were however included later with iso eight eight five nine one five which also introduced the new euro character likewise dutch did not get the and letters because dutch speakers had gotten used to typing these as two letters instead romanian did not initially get its and with comma letters because these letters were initially unified with and with cedilla by the unicode consortium considering the shapes with comma beneath to be glyph variants of the shapes with cedilla however the letters with explicit comma below were later added to the unicode standard and are also in iso eight eight five nine one six most of the iso eight eight five nine encodings provide diacritic marks required for various european languages others provide non roman alphabets greek cyrillic hebrew arabic and thai most of the encodings contain only spacing characters although the hebrew and arabic ones do also contain combining characters however the standard makes no provision for the scripts of east asian languages cjk as their ideographic writing systems require many thousands of code points although it uses latin based characters vietnamese does not fit into nine six positions without using combining diacritics either japanese syllabic kana scripts on the other hand might but like several other alphabets of the world isn t encoded in the iso eight eight five nine system the parts of iso eight eight five nine iso eight eight five nine is divided into the following parts only the letter ij is missing which is usually represented as ij missing characters are in iso eight eight five nine one five missing characters were reintroduced into ukrainian in one nine nine one each part of iso eight eight five nine is designed to support languages that often borrow from each other so the characters needed by each language are usually accommodated by a single part however there are some characters and language combinations that are not accommodated without transcriptions efforts were made to make conversions as smooth as possible for example german has all its seven special chars at the same positions in all latin variants one four nine one zero one three one six and in many positions the characters only differ in the diacritics between the sets in particular variants one four were designed jointly and have the property that every encoded character appears either at a given position or not at all table at position zero xa zero there s always the non breaking space and zero xad is mostly the soft hyphen which only shows at line breaks other empty fields are either unassigned or the system used isn t able to display them there are new additions as iso iec eight eight five nine seven two zero zero three and iso iec eight eight five nine eight one nine nine nine versions lrm stands for left to right mark u two zero zero e and rlm stands for right to left mark u two zero zero f relationship to unicode and the ucs since one nine nine one the unicode consortium has been working with iso to develop the unicode standard and iso iec one zero six four six the universal character set ucs in tandem this pair of standards was created to unify the iso eight eight five nine character repertoire among others by assigning each character initially to a one six bit code value with some code values left unassigned over time their models adapted to map characters to abstract numeric code points rather than fixed bit width values so that more code points and encoding methods could be supported unicode and iso iec one zero six four six currently assign about one zero zero zero zero zero characters to a code space consisting of over a million code points and they define several standard encodings that are capable of representing every available code point the standard encodings of unicode and the ucs use sequences of one to four eight bit code values utf eight sequences of one or two one six bit code values utf one six or one three two bit code value utf three two or ucs four there is also an older encoding that uses one one six bit code value ucs two capable of representing one seventeenth of the available code points of these encoding forms only utf eight s byte sequences are in a fixed order the others are subject to platform dependent byte ordering issues that may be addressed via special codes or indicated via out of band means newer editions of iso eight eight five nine express characters in terms of their unicode ucs names and the u nnnn notation effectively causing each part of iso eight eight five nine to be a unicode ucs character encoding scheme that maps a very small subset of the ucs to single eight bit bytes the first two five six characters in unicode and the ucs are identical to those in iso eight eight five nine one single byte character sets including the parts of iso eight eight five nine and derivatives of them were favored throughout the one nine nine zero s having the advantages of being well established and more easily implemented in software the equation of one byte to one character is simple and adequate for most single language applications and there are no combining characters or variant forms as the relative cost in computing resources of using more than one byte per character began to diminish programming languages and operating systems added native support for unicode alongside their system of code pages windows nt was quite an early adopter of unicode however unicode support in windows nine x required linking with a special compatibility layer or restricting your design to a very small subset of the windows api discouraging its use as unicode enabled operating systems became more widespread iso eight eight five nine and other legacy encodings became less popular while remnants of iso eight eight five nine and single byte character models remain entrenched in many operating systems programming languages data storage systems networking applications display hardware and end user application software most modern computing applications use unicode internally and rely on conversion tables to map to and from other encodings when necessary development status the iso iec eight eight five nine standard was maintained by iso iec joint

approximately seven five zero nm and one mm different regions in the infrared ir is often subdivided into near infrared nir ir a din zero seven five one four m in wavelength defined by the water

especially at the telecom wavelengths the spectrum is further subdivided into individual bands due to limitations of detectors amplifiers and sources infrared radiation is often linked to heat since objects at room temperature or above will emit radiation mostly concentrated in the mid infrared band see black body plot of atmospheric transmittance in part of the infrared region the common nomenclature is justified by the different human response to this radiation near infrared the red you just cannot see far ir thermal radiation other definitions follow different physical mechanisms emission peaks vs bands water absorption and the newest follow technical reasons the common silicon detectors are sensitive to about one zero five zero nm while ingaas sensitivity starts around nine five zero nm and ends between one seven zero zero and two two zero zero nm depending on the specific configuration unfortunately the international standards for these specifications are not currently available the boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined the human eye is markedly less sensitive to red light above seven zero zero nm wavelength but particularly intense light e g from lasers can be detected up to approximately seven eight zero nm the onset of infrared is defined according to different standards at various values between these two wavelengths typically at seven five zero nm telecommunication bands in the infrared optical telecommunication in the near infrared is technically often separated to different frequency bands because of

the earth s surface absorbs visible radiation from the sun and re emits much of the energy as infrared back to the atmosphere certain gases in the atmosphere chiefly water vapor but also carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide sulfur hexafluoride and chlorofluorocarbons absorb this infrared and re radiate it in all directions including back to earth thus the greenhouse effect keeps the atmosphere and surface much warmer than if the infrared absorbers were absent from the atmosphere applications night vision infrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient visible light to see an object the radiation is detected and turned into an image on a screen hotter objects showing up in different shades than cooler objects enabling the police and military to acquire thermally significant targets such as human beings and automobiles also see forward looking infrared ir radiation is a secondary effect of heat it is not heat itself heat itself is a measure of the translational energy of an amount of matter thermal detectors do not actually detect heat directly but the difference in ir radiation from objects military gunnery ranges sometimes use special materials that reflect ir radiation to simulate enemy vehicles with running engines the targets can be the exact same temperature as the surrounding terrain but they emit reflect much more ir radiation different materials emit more or less ir radiation as temperature increases or decreases depending on the composition of the material smoke is more transparent to infrared than to visible light so firefighters use infrared imaging equipment when working in smoke filled areas other imaging in infrared photography infrared filters are used to capture only the infrared spectrum digital cameras often use infrared blockers cheaper digital cameras and some camera phones which do not have appropriate filters can see infrared appearing as a bright white colour try pointing a tv remote at your digital camera this is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near bright areas such as near a lamp where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image it is also worth mentioning t ray imaging which is imaging using far infrared or terahertz radiation technically more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques t ray imaging has been of considerable interest recently due to a number of new developments such as terahertz time domain spectroscopy thermography infrared radiation can be used to remotely determine the temperature of objects if the emissivity is known this is termed thermography or in the case of very hot objects in the nir or visible it is termed pyrometry thermography thermal imaging is mainly used in military and industrial applications but the technology is reaching the public market in the form of infrared cameras on cars due to the massively reduced production costs heating infrared radiation is used in infrared saunas to heat the sauna s occupants and to remove ice from the wings of aircraft de icing it is also gaining popularity as a method of heating asphalt pavements in place during new construction or in repair of damaged asphalt communications ir data transmission is also employed in short range communication among computer peripherals and personal digital assistants these devices usually conform to standards published by irda the infrared data association remote controls and irda devices use infrared light emitting diodes leds to emit infrared radiation which is focused by a plastic lens into a narrow beam the beam is modulated i e switched on and off to encode the data the receiver uses a silicon photodiode to convert the infrared radiation to an electric current it responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density ir does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms free space optical communication using infrared lasers can be a relatively inexpensive way to install a gigabit s communications link in urban areas compared to the cost of burying fibre optic cable infrared lasers are used to provide the light for optical fibre communications systems infrared light with a wavelength around one three three zero nm least dispersion or one five five zero nm best transmission are the best choices for standard silica fibres infrared is the most common way for remote controls to command appliances spectroscopy infrared radiation spectroscopy is the study of the composition of usually organic compounds finding out a compound s structure and composition based on the percentage transmittance of ir radiation through a sample different frequencies are absorbed by different stretches and bends in the molecular bonds

is an international standard for date and time representations the signature feature of the iso eight six zero one format is that all values are organized from most to least significant this leads to the increasingly familiar yyyy mm dd hh mm ss format seen in international forums history of the standard the current version is the third edition iso eight six zero one two zero zero four published two zero zero four one two zero three this replaces the second edition iso eight six zero one two zero zero zero the first edition was iso eight six zero one one nine eight eight general principles dates and times are self contained and do not rely on any external context for their values they are entirely numerical in representation although certain specialized formats use roman letters to label fields every iso date has exactly one possible unambiguous interpretation these properties allow them to be truly international without reliance on regional conventions such as the names of the days of the week dates and times are organized from most to least significant digits each value eg year month day time has a fixed number of digits which must be padded with leading zeros for instance the american notation four three zero am would be written zero four three zero representation can be done in one of two formats a basic format with a minimal number of characters or an extended format with separators to enhance human readability the standard permits a dash separator between date elements and a colon between hours minutes and seconds for example two zero zero six zero one zero six may be written two zero zero six zero one zero six without ambiguity an optional t is suggested to separate date and time when those values will be stored in a single field though another separator may be chosen with discretion a space is a popular allowed human readable alternative any number of fields may be dropped from any of the date and time formats but the least significant fields must be dropped first for example two zero zero four zero five is a valid iso eight six zero one date which indicates the five th month of the year two zero zero four this date will never represent the five th day of some unknown month in two zero zero four finally the standard supports the addition of a decimal fraction to the smallest time unit where higher precision is needed dates the standard uses the gregorian calendar already the de facto standard of international trade with the year numbering following astronomical year numbering the standard acknowledges that other calendars may be used such as the julian calendar it suggests that senders and receivers should explicitly agree when another calendar is used with the standard s notation dates are otherwise assumed to be gregorian in principle dates should usually be converted to the proleptic gregorian calendar to avoid possible confusion years are always integers year zero zero zero one corresponds to one ad one ce the year before that is zero zero zero zero which corresponds to one bc one bce the year before that is zero zero zero one which corresponds to two bc this pattern continues this system had already been used by astronomers and may clarify the dispute about when a new century begins see two zero th century in some cases years may be relaxed to fewer than four digits however the rules for this vary depending on what other information is being carried and if it will make the interpretation ambiguous for instance the date two zero zero six zero one zero nine could be written zero six zero one zero nine but the month two zero zero six zero one could only be shortened as zero six zero one note the hyphen years can also be expanded to greater than four digits though this is practically domain specific such as archeological and astronomical events iso eight six zero one describes three date formats of general interest these can be quickly distinguished by a one two or three digit day field calendar date calendar dates are the form familiar to most people as represented above yyyy indicates a year with century and a negative sign for years before one bce mm indicates the month of the year zero one through one two dd indicates the day of that month from zero one through three one for example april five th one nine eight one may be represented as one nine eight one zero four zero five in the extended format or one nine eight one zero four zero five in the basic format the standard allows for dates to be written with less precision for example you may write one nine eight one zero four to mean april one nine eight one you may simply write one nine eight one to refer to that year the standard also allows for dates which include an implied element such as an implied century it is careful to emphasize the importance of clear communication between sender and receiver when implied elements are being used it is a lack of such clarity that led to the year two zero zero zero problem week dates week dates are a form more popular in manufacturing as represented above yyyy indicates a iso year the w is a literal roman character followed by ww which represents the week number from zero one through five two or five three the d represents the day of the week from one through seven beginning with monday and ending with sunday for example one nine eight one zero four zero five is the seven th day of the one four th week of one nine eight one and would be written one nine eight one w one four seven or in its most compact form eight one w one four seven week zero one is the week with the year s first thursday in it or in other words the first week with the majority four or more of its days in the new year if one january is on a monday tuesday wednesday or thursday it is in week zero one if one january is on a friday saturday or sunday it is in week five two or five three of the previous year weeks zero one five two and five three can thus include days from more than one year and in most years do so for example two zero zero eight one two two eight is written two zero zero nine w zero one one and two zero one zero zero one zero one is written two zero zero nine w five three seven the year given by the week format is often called the iso year opposed to the gregorian year used in calendar dates ordinal dates ordinal dates are a simple form for times when the arbitrary nature of week and month definitions are more of an impediment than an aid for instance when comparing dates from different calendars as represented above yyyy indicates a year ddd is the day of that year from zero zero one through three six six in leap years for example one nine eight one zero four zero five is also one nine eight one zero nine five this format has particular use for simple hardware systems that have need of a date system but where including full calendar calculation software may be a significant nuisance further details about dates the standard allows for expansion and truncation of the year by agreement between sender and receiver truncation means the year may be written with two digits optionally preceded by a hyphen to represent a year in an implied century unfortunately common practice is to use two digits for either a year in an implied modern century or in the first century eight nine might be eight nine or one nine eight nine expansion means that the year may be written with more than four digits which addresses the year one zero zero zero zero problem by allowing the standard to specify dates later than ad one zero zero zero zero or earlier than one zero zero zero one bc note however that expansion and truncation introduce ambiguities if separators are not used for instance two zero zero four zero six could either mean the year two zero zero four zero six or month zero six in year two zero zero four the iso standard suggests that provisions be made to prevent such confusions for purposes of reference iso eight six zero one assigns the number one eight seven five to the year in which the convention du m tre was signed in paris times iso eight six zero one uses the two four hour clock system that is used by much of the world the basic format is hhmmss and the extended format is hh mm ss hh refers to an hour between zero zero and two four where two four is only used to notate the midnight at the end of a calendar date mm refers to a minute between zero zero and five nine ss refers to a second between zero zero and five nine or six zero in the exceptional case of an added leap second so a time might appear as one three four seven three zero or one three four seven three zero it is also acceptable to omit elements to reduce precision hh mm hhmm and hh are all used fractions may also be used with all three of the time elements these are indicated by using the decimal point either a comma or dot a fraction may only refer to the most precise component of a time representation that is to denote one four hours three zero and one half minutes do not include a seconds figure represent it as one four three zero five or one four three zero five the may be replaced with a depending on the local custom midnight is a special case and can be referred to as both zero zero zero zero and two four zero zero the notation zero zero zero zero is used at the beginning of the day and is the most frequently used one at the end of a day use two four zero zero note that one nine eight one zero four zero five two four zero zero is the same instant as one nine eight one zero four zero six zero zero zero zero time zones if no time zone information is given with a time the time zone is assumed to be in some conventional local timezone while it may be safe to assume a local zone when used between two people in the same area it is ambiguous when used in communication between multiple timezones it is usually preferable to indicate a time zone using the standard s notation utc if the time is in utc it is very easy to show this simply add a z directly after the time without a space zero nine three zero utc is therefore represented as zero nine three zero z or zero nine three zero z one four four five one five utc would be one four four five one five z or one four four five one five z other time zones other time zones are specified by their offset from utc in the format hh mm hhmm or hh so if the time being described is one hour ahead of utc such as the time in berlin during the winter the offset would be zero one zero zero zero one zero zero or simply zero one this is appended to the time in the same way that z was above note that the offset is the actual offset from utc and doesn t include any information on daylight saving time times expressed in local time for a user in chicago illinois would be zero six zero zero for the winter central standard time and zero five zero zero for the summer central daylight time the following times all refer to the same moment one eight three zero z two two three zero zero four one one three zero zero seven zero zero and one five zero zero zero three three zero it could also be expressed using a fraction of the hour as one eight five z combined representations combining date and time representations is quite simple it is in the format of t the and sections are any proper representation of the date and time created by following the standard a common use could be yyyy mm ddthh mm ss hh mm one nine eight one zero four zero five t one four three zero three zero zero five zero zero for example the standard allows the replacement of t with a space if no misunderstanding arises this is commonly done for human communications a date time with timezone like one nine eight one zero four zero five t one four three zero zero five would then be written as one nine eight one zero four zero five one four three zero zero five duration durations are represented by the format pnynmndtnhnmns nm may be replaced with nw to use the week format in this representation replace n with the appropriate number for the element that follows it leading zeros are optional but may clarify ambiguous durations the capital letters p y m w d t h m and s are used as they are and not replaced thus p three y six m four dt one two h three zero m zero s defines a period of three years six months four days twelve hours thirty minutes and zero seconds elements may be omitted if their value is zero alternately a format more similar to the combined representation may be used pyyyy mm ddthh mm ss to represent the same interval as above in this format use p zero zero zero three zero six zero four t one two three zero zero zero time interval time intervals specify an amount of time they may be specified in four ways start and end such as two zero zero two zero three zero one t one three zero zero zero zero z two zero zero three zero five one one t one five three zero zero zero z start and duration such as two zero zero two zero three zero one t one three zero zero zero zero z p one y two m one zero dt two h three zero m duration and end such as p one y two m one zero dt two h three zero m two zero zero three zero five one one t one five three zero zero zero z duration only such as p one y two m one zero dt two h three zero m of these the first three require two separate values separated by the interval designator which is usually a forward slash the double hyphen is permissible in some applications but is not preferred an example using the format from item one is one nine eight one zero four zero five t one four three zero three zero zero five zero zero two zero zero four zero seven one four t one five three zero three zero zero five zero zero if any elements are missing from the second value they are assumed to be the same as the first value including time zone elements repeating intervals repeating intervals are formed by adding rn to the beginning of an interval expression where r is used as the letter itself and n is replaced by the number of repetitions leaving out the value for n means an unbounded number of repetitions so to repeat the interval of p one y two m one zero dt two h three zero m five times starting at two zero zero two zero three zero one t one three zero zero zero zero z use r five two zero zero two zero three zero one t one three zero zero zero zero z p one y two m one zero dt two h three zero

entity to a change in its velocity relative to an inertial frame the inertial frame does not have to be that of the mass in question either before or after the measurement this resistance is also sometimes called inertia within classical physics the inertial mass of point particles is defined by means of the following equation for the subsequently described machian thought experiment where particle one is taken as a unit m one one m i a i one m one a one i where m i is the inertial mass of particle i and a i one is the initial acceleration of particle i in the direction from particle i to particle one in a volume occupied only by particles i and one where both particles are initially at rest one distance unit apart there are no external forces but the particles exert a force on each other the equation defines inertial mass of particle i in terms of the assumed measurable mutually induced accelerations a i one and a one i the remaining constraints on the accelerations that the above defining equation still holds at different initial distances and when generated by the pairing of particles with other than particle one can be taken as requirements for the experimental validity of the theory s dynamics cf momentum conservation in addition the requirement that the paired accelerations used are colinear irrelevant of the direction chosen for the alignment of the particles verifies that they are measured relative to an inertial frame in a force free volume mass as an acronymn isa stands for independent schools association a group of schools in new south wales

control all mineral related activities in the international seabed area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction an area underlying most of the world s oceans it is an autonomous organization having a relationship agreement with the united nations the authority in existence since one nine nine four was established and its tasks were defined by the one nine eight two united nations convention on the law of the sea as refined by the one nine nine four agreement relating to the implementation of part xi seabed provisions of the convention the convention defines this deep seabed area and its resources as the common heritage of mankind the authority has one three eight member states its membership consisting of all parties to the law of the sea convention two principal organs establish the policies and govern the work of the authority the assembly in which all members are represented and a three six member council elected by the assembly council members are chosen according to a formula designed to ensure equitable representation of countries from various groups including those engaged in seabed mineral exploration and the land based producers of minerals found on the seabed the authority holds one annual session usually of two weeks duration its eighth session was held in august two zero zero two its ninth session is scheduled for july august two zero zero three the authority operates by contracting with private and public corporations and other entities authorizing them to explore and eventually exploit specified areas on the deep seabed for mineral resources the convention also established a body called the enterprise which is to serve as the authority s own mining operator but no concrete steps have been taken to bring this into being the authority s sole substantive accomplishment to date has been the adoption in two zero zero zero of regulations governing exploration for polymetallic nodules these resources also called manganese nodules contain varying amounts of manganese cobalt copper and nickel they occur as potato sized lumps scattered about on the surface of the ocean floor mainly in the central pacific ocean but with some deposits in the indian ocean during the first half of two zero zero one the authority signed exploration contracts with seven entities giving them exclusive rights to explore for nodules in specific areas under terms spelled out in the regulations these contractors submitted their first set of annual reports to the authority in two zero zero two none indicated any serious interest in commercial exploitation the authority began work in august two zero zero two on another set of regulations covering polymetallic sulphides and cobalt rich crusts rich sources of such minerals as copper iron zinc silver and gold as well as cobalt the sulphides are found around volcanic hot springs especially in the western pacific ocean while the crusts occur on oceanic ridges and elsewhere at several locations around the world this task is likely to take several years in addition to its legislative work the authority organizes annual workshops on various aspects of seabed exploration with emphasis on measures to protect the marine environment from any harmful consequences it disseminates the results of these meetings through publications the authority has a budget of slightly more than five million a year and a staff of nearly four zero people contrary to early hopes that seabed mining would generate extensive revenues for both the exploiting countries and the authority no technology has been developed for gathering deep sea minerals at costs that can compete with land based mines the general consensus is that economic mining of the ocean depths is decades away in addition the united states with some of

ibm compatibles bus architecture the modern one six bit standard was introduced in one nine eight four designed to connect peripheral cards to the motherboard the protocol also allows for bus mastering although only the first one six mb of main memory is available for direct access the eight bit bus ran at four seven seven mhz while the one six bit bus operated at eight mhz in reference to the xt bus it is sometimes referred to as the at bus architecture it was also available on some non ibm compatible machines such as the short lived at plug n play this was rare users frequently had to configure two or three things when adding a new device such as the irq line i o address or dma channel mca had done away with this complication and pci actually incorporated many of the ideas first explored with mca though it was more directly descended from eisa this trouble with configuration eventually led to the creation of isa pnp a plug n play system that used a combination of modifications to hardware the system bios and operating system software to automatically manage the nitty gritty details in reality isa pnp turned out to be a major headache much of the time and didn t become well supported until the architecture was in its final days this was a major contributor to the use of the phrase plug n pray pci slots were the first physically incompatible expansion ports to directly squeeze isa off of the motherboard at first motherboards were largely isa including a few pci slots by the mid one nine nine zero s the two slot types were roughly balanced and isa slots soon were in the minority on consumer systems microsoft s pc nine eight specification recommended that isa slots be removed entirely though the system architecture still required isa to be present in some vestigial way internally to handle the floppy drive serial ports etc isa slots remained for a few more years and it was even possible to see systems with an accelerated graphics port agp sitting near the central processing unit an array of pci slots and one or two isa slots near the end it is also notable that pci slots are rotated compared to their isa counterparts pci cards were essentially inserted upside down allowing isa and pci connectors to squeeze together on the motherboard only one of the two connectors can be used in each slot at a time but this allowed for greater flexibility

disambiguation ipcc is science authority for the unfccc the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc was established in one nine eight eight by two united nations organizations the world meteorological organization wmo and the united nations environment programme unep to assess the risk of human induced climate change the panel is open to all members of the wmo and unep ipcc reports are widely cited in almost any debate related to climate change the reports have been influential in forming national and international responses to climate change a small but vocal minority less than one five of the scientists involved with the report have accused the ipcc of bias aims the principles of the ipcc operation are assigned by the relevant wmo executive council and unep governing council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the un framework convention on climate change process the role of the ipcc is to assess on a comprehensive objective open and transparent basis the scientific technical and socio economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human induced climate change its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation ipcc reports should be neutral with respect to policy although they may need to deal objectively with scientific technical and socio economic factors relevant to the application of particular policies review is an essential part of the ipcc process since the ipcc is an intergovernmental body review of ipcc documents should involve both peer review by experts and review by governments the stated aims of the ipcc are to assess scientific information relevant to human induced climate change the impacts of human induced climate change options for adaptation and mitigation the history of the ipcc is described here operations the current chair of the ipcc is rajendra k pachauri elected in may two zero zero two previously robert watson headed the ipcc the ipcc panel is composed of representatives appointed by governments and organizations participation of delegates with appropriate expertise is encouraged plenary sessions of the ipcc and ipcc working groups are held at the level of government representatives non governmental and intergovernmental organisations may be allowed to attend as observers sessions of the ipcc bureau workshops expert and lead authors meetings are by invitation only attendance at the two zero zero three meeting was three five zero government officials and climate change experts after the opening ceremonies plenary sessions are closed meetings the meeting report states there were three two two persons in attendance at sessions and with about seven eighths of participants being from governmental organizations the ipcc is led by government scientists but also involves several hundred academic scientists and researchers it synthesises the available information about climate change and global warming has published four major reports reviewing the latest climate science as well as more specialized reports the ipcc does not carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data or other relevant parameters it bases its assessment mainly on peer reviewed and published scientific technical literature there are several major groups ipcc panel meets in plenary session about once a year and controls the organization s structure and procedures the panel is the ipcc corporate entity chair elected by the panel secretariat oversees and manages all activities supported by unep and wmo bureau elected by the panel chaired by the chair three zero members include ipcc vice chairs co chairs and vice chairs of working groups and task force working groups each has two co chairs one from the developed and one from developing world and a technical support unit working group i assesses scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change working group ii assesses vulnerability of socio economic and natural systems to climate change consequences and adaptation options working group iii assesses options for limiting greenhouse gas emissions and otherwise mitigating climate change task force on national greenhouse gas inventories the ipcc receives funding from unep wmo and its own trust fund for which it solicits contributions from governments activities the ipcc concentrates its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant wmo executive council and unep governing council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the un framework convention on climate change process the ipcc is currently april two zero zero six in the process of preparing the ipcc fourth assessment report or ar four reports of the workshops held so far are available working group i report is due to be finalised during the first quarter of two zero zero seven as of may two zero zero five there have been three ar four meetings with only public information being meeting locations an author list one invitation one agenda and one list of presentation titles working group ii report is due to be finalised in mid two zero zero seven as of may two zero zero five there have been two ar four meetings with no public information released one shared meeting with wg iii has taken place with a published summary working group iii report is due to be finalized in mid two zero zero seven as of may two zero zero five there has been one ar four meeting with no public information released if it is decided to prepare one the ar four synthesis report syr would be finalised during the last quarter of two zero zero seven documentation on the scoping meetings for the ar four are available as are the outlines for the wg i report and a provisional author list while the preparation of the assessment reports is a major ipcc function it also supports other activities such as the data distribution centre and the national greenhouse gas inventories programme required under the unfccc this involves publishing default emission factors which are factors used to derive emissions estimates based on the levels of fuel consumption industrial production and so on the ipcc also often answers inquiries from the unfccc subsidiary body for scientific and technological advice sbsta publications the ipcc reports are a compendium of peer reviewed and published science each subsequent ipcc report notes areas where the science has improved since the previous report and also notes areas where further research is required authors for the ipcc reports are chosen from a list of researchers prepared by governments and participating organisations and the working group task force bureaux and other experts as appropriate known through their publications and works four two one two the composition of the group of coordinating lead authors and lead authors for a section or chapter of a report is intended to reflect the need to aim for a range of views expertise and geographical representation ensuring appropriate representation of experts from developing and developed countries and countries with economies in transition there are generally three stages in the review process expert review six eight weeks government expert review government review of summaries for policymakers overview chapters synthesis report review comments are in an open archive for at least five years there are several types of endorsement which documents receive approval material has been subjected to detailed line by line discussion and agreement working group summaries for policymakers are approved by their working groups synthesis report summary for policymakers is approved by panel adoption endorsed section by section and not line by line panel adopts overview chapters of methodology reports panel adopts ipcc synthesis report acceptance not been subject to line by line discussion and agreement but presents a comprehensive objective and balanced view of the subject matter working groups accepts their reports task force reports are accepted by the panel working group summaries for policymakers are accepted by the panel after group approval the panel is responsible for the ipcc and its endorsement of reports allows it to ensure they meet ipcc standards the panel s approval process has been criticized for changing the product of the experts who create the reports on the other hand not requiring panel re endorsement of reports has also been criticized after changes required by the approval process were made to reports ipcc reports the ipcc published a first assessment report in one nine nine zero a supplementary report in one nine nine two a second assessment report sar in one nine nine five and a third assessment report tar in two zero zero one a fourth assessment report ar four is currently underway each of the assessment reports is in three volumes from the working groups i ii and iii unqualified the ipcc report is often used to mean the wg i report consensus in reports ipcc reports attempt to present a scientific consensus view the general approach of identifying consensus among a group of climate scientists means that areas where there remains considerable uncertainty tend to be automatically deemphasized or simply omitted another means of handling consensus problems was used in the sres scenarios where due to a lack of consensus there were many variations included with no indication of which are more probable firstly the panel as a whole must always respect and consider the specific perspectives of each member but more importantly each member must respect and consider the perspectives of the entire panel consensus is not something that happens by itself it is an outcome that has to be shaped and the only basis for shaping it is to follow the two cardinal rules that i have just mentioned dr rajendra k pachauri chairman of the ipcc ipcc fourth assessment report ar four main article ipcc fourth assessment report work on the fourth

vulnerability working group iii mitigation synthesis report the headlines from the summary for policymakers in the scientific basis were an increasing body of observations gives a collective picture of a warming world and other changes in the climate system the global average surface temperature has increased over the two zero th century by about zero six c temperatures have risen during the past four decades in the lowest eight kilometres of the atmosphere snow cover and ice extent have decreased emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols due to human activities continue to alter the atmosphere in ways that are expected to affect the climate anthropogenic aerosols are short lived and mostly produce negative radiative forcing natural factors have made small contributions to radiative forcing over the past century confidence in the ability of models to project future climate has increased complex physically based climate models are required to provide detailed estimates of feedbacks and of regional features such models cannot yet simulate all aspects of climate e g they still cannot account fully for the observed trend in the surface troposphere temperature difference since one nine seven nine and there are particular uncertainties associated with clouds and their interaction with radiation and aerosols nevertheless confidence in the ability of these models to provide useful projections of future climate has improved due to their demonstrated performance on a range of space and time scales there is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last five zero years is attributable to human activities human influences will continue to change atmospheric composition throughout the two one st century global average temperature and sea level are projected to rise under all ipcc sres scenarios the tar estimate for the climate sensitivity is one five to four five c and the average surface temperature is projected to increase by one four to five eight celsius degrees over the period one nine nine zero to two one zero zero and the sea level is projected to rise by zero one to zero nine metres over the same period the wide range in predictions is based upon several different scenarios that assume different levels of future co two emissions each scenario then has a range of possible outcomes associated with it the most optimistic outcome assumes an aggressive campaign to reduce co two emissions while the most pessimistic is a business as usual scenario the more realistic scenarios fall in between ipcc predictions are based on the same models used to establish the importance of the different factors in global warming these models need data about anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols these data are predicted from economic models based on three five different scenarios scenarios go from pessimistic to optimistic and predictions of global warming depend on the kind of scenario considered ipcc uses the best available predictions and their reports are under strong scientific scrutiny the ipcc concedes that there is a need for better models and better scientific understanding of some climate phenomena as well as the uncertainties involved critics assert that the available data is not sufficient to determine the real importance of greenhouse gases in climate change sensitivity of climate to greenhouse gases may be overestimated or underestimated because of some flaws in the models and because the importance of some external factors may be misestimated the predictions are based on scenarios and the ipcc did not assign any probability to the three five scenarios used debate over climate change two zero zero one economic growth estimates castles and henderson asserted that the ipcc has been using inflated economic growth rates which result in increased emission estimates this was incorrect because ipcc growth and emissions rates were based upon several factors and not only gdp as rebutted by nebojsa nakicenovic et al physical modeling see also global climate model a few participants in ipcc working group i science do not agree with the ipcc reports of the one two zero lead authors two have complained a particularly active critic mit physicist richard lindzen expressed his unhappiness about those portions in the executive summary based on his contributions in may two zero zero one before the u s senate committee on commerce science and transportation the summary does not reflect the full document for example i worked on chapter seven physical processes this chapter dealt with the nature of the basic processes which determine the response of climate and found numerous problems with model treatments including those of clouds and water vapor the chapter was summarized with the following sentence understanding of climate processes and their incorporation in climate models have improved including water vapour sea ice dynamics and ocean heat transport the summary for policymakers of the wg one reports does include caveats on model treatments such models cannot yet simulate all aspects of climate e g they still cannot account fully for the observed trend in the surface troposphere temperature difference since one nine seven nine and there are particular uncertainties associated with clouds and their interaction with radiation and aerosols nevertheless confidence in the ability of these models to provide useful projections of future climate has improved due to their demonstrated performance on a range of space and time scales these statements are in turn supported by the executive summary of chapter eight of the report which includes coupled models can provide credible simulations of both the present annual mean climate and the climatological seasonal cycle over broad continental scales for most variables of interest for climate change clouds and humidity remain sources of significant uncertainty but there have been incremental improvements in simulations of these quantities confidence in the ability of models to project future climates is increased by the ability of several models to reproduce the warming trend in two zero th century surface air temperature when driven by radiative forcing due to increasing greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols however only idealised scenarios of only sulphate aerosols have been used ipcc second assessment report climate change one nine nine five main article ipcc second assessment report climate change one nine nine five the ipcc second assessment report sar was finished in one nine nine six it is split into four parts a synthesis to help interpret unfccc article two the science of climate change wg i impacts adaptations and mitigation of climate change wg ii economic and social dimensions of climate change wg iii each of the last three parts was completed by a separate working group and each has a summary for policymakers sfp that represents a consensus of national representatives the sfp of the wg i report contains headings greenhouse gas concentrations have continued to increase anthropogenic aerosols tend to produce negative radiative forcings climate has changed over the past century air temperature has increased by between zero three and zero six c since the late one nine th century this estimate has not significantly changed since the one nine nine zero report the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate considerable progress since the one nine nine zero report in distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic influences on climate because of including aerosols coupled models pattern based studies climate is expected to continue to change in the future increasing realism of simulations increases confidence important uncertainties remain but are taken into account in the range of model projections there are still many uncertainties estimates of future emissions and biogeochemical cycling models instrument data for model testing assessment of variability and detection studies debate over climate change one nine nine five most scientists involved in climate research believe that the ipcc reports accurately summarise the state of knowledge few scientists have objected and made public comments to that effect the report formed the basis of negotiations over the kyoto protocol a december two zero one nine nine five reuters report quoted british scientist keith shine one of ipcc s lead authors discussing the policymakers summary he said we produce a draft and then the policymakers go through it line by line and change the way it is presented it s peculiar that they have the final say in what goes into a scientists report it is not clear in this case whether shine was complaining that the report had been changed to be more skeptical or less or something else entirely dr frederick seitz president emeritus of rockefeller university and past president of the national academy of sciences has publicly denounced the ipcc report writing i have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer review process than the events that led to this ipcc report he opposed it in the leipzig declaration of his science and environmental policy project in turn seitz s comments were vigorously opposed by the presidents of the american meteorological society and university corporation for atmospheric research who wrote about a systematic effort by some individuals to undermine and discredit the scientific process that has led many scientists working on understanding climate to conclude that there is a very real possibility that humans are modifying earth s climate on a global scale rather than carrying out a legitimate scientific debate they are waging in the public media a vocal campaign against scientific results with which they disagree s fred singer disseminated a letter about what he learned about changes to chapter eight interpretations of the ipcc summary s key conclusion and some policy implications chapter eight was altered substantially in order to make it conform to the summary three key clauses expressing the consensus of authors contributors and reviewers should have been placed into the summary instead of being deleted from the approved draft chapter the ambiguous phrase the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate has been mis interpreted by policymakers to mean that a major global warming catastrophe will soon be upon us the ipcc report and its authors are being mis used by politicians and others to push an ideologically based agenda dr benjamin d santer convening lead author of chapter eight of one nine nine five ipcc working group i report replied all revisions were made with the sole purpose of producing the best possible and most clearly explained assessment of the science and were under the full scientific control of the convening lead author of chapter eight changes were made in direct response to written comments made by governments and non governmental organizations ngos during october and november one nine nine five comments made by governments and ngos during the plenary sessions of the ipcc meeting that was held in madrid from november two seven two nine th one nine nine five post madrid changes to chapter eight were made solely in response to review comments and or in order to clarify scientific points after receiving much criticism of the redundancy of a concluding summary section eight seven in october and november one nine nine five the convening lead author of chapter eight decided to remove it about half of the information in the concluding summary was integrated with material in section eight six the bottom line assessment of the science in the october nine th draft of chapter eight was taken together these results point towards a human influence on climate the final assessment in the now published summary for policymakers is that the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate the latter sentence which is entirely consistent with the earlier oct nine th sentence was unanimously approved at the madrid meeting by delegates from nearly one zero zero countries none of the changes were politically motivated ipcc supplementary report one nine nine two the one nine nine two supplementary report was an update requested in the context of the negotiations on the framework convention on climate change at the earth summit united nations conference on environment and development in rio de janeiro in one nine nine two the major conclusion was that research since one nine nine zero did not affect our fundamental understanding of the science of the greenhouse effect and either confirm or do not justify alteration of the major conclusions of the first ipcc scientific assessment it noted that transient time dependent simulations which had been very preliminary in the far were now improved but did not include aerosol or ozone changes ipcc first assessment report one nine nine zero the ipcc first assessment report was completed in one nine nine zero and served as the basis of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc the executive summary of the policymakers summary of the wg i report includes we are certain of the following there is a natural greenhouse effect emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases co two methane cfcs and nitrous oxide these increases will enhance the greenhouse effect resulting on average in an additional warming of the earth s surface the main greenhouse gas water vapour will increase in response to global warming and further enhance it we calculate with confidence that co two has been responsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse effect long lived gases would require immeadiate reductions in emissions from human activities of over six zero to stabilise their concentrations at today s levels based on current models we predict under bau increase of global mean temperature during the two one st century of about zero three oc per decade with an uncertainty range of zero two to zero five oc per decade this is greater than that seen over the past one zero zero zero zero years under other scenarios which assume progressively increasing levels of controls rates of increase in global mean temperature of about zero two oc to about zero one oc per decade there are many uncertainties in our predictions particularly with regard to the timing magnitude and regional patterns of climate change due to our incomplete understanding of sources and sinks of ghgs clouds oceans polar ice sheets our judgement is that global mean surface air temperature has increased by zero three to zero six oc over the last one zero zero years the size of this warming is broadly consistent with predicion of climate models but it is also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability thus the observed increase could be largely due to this natural variability alternatively this variability and other human factors could have offset a still larger human induced greenhouse warming the unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect is not likely for a decade or more debate over ipcc first assessment report one nine nine zero in one nine nine one the sepp the science i personally cannot in good faith continue to contribute to a process that i view as both being motivated by pre conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound as the ipcc leadership has seen no wrong in dr trenberth s actions and have retained him as a lead author for the ar four i have decided to no longer participate in the ipcc ar four ipcc processes the ipcc is monolithic and complacent and it is conceivable that they are exaggerating the speed of change john maddox a former editor of the journal nature quoted by david adam in the guardian two eight january two zero zero five uk house of lords science and economic analysis and report on ipcc for the g eight summit july two zero zero five we have some concerns about the objectivity of the ipcc process with some of its emissions scenarios and summary documentation apparently influenced by political considerations there are significant doubts about some aspects of the ipcc s emissions scenario exercise in particular the high emissions scenarios the government should press the ipcc to change their approach there are some positive aspects to global warming and these appear to have been played down in the ipcc reports the government should press the ipcc to reflect in a more balanced way the costs and benefits of climate change the government should press the ipcc for better estimates of the monetary costs of global warming damage and for explicit monetary comparisons between the costs of measures to control warming and their benefits since warming will continue regardless of action now due to the lengthy time lags see also global warming external links the ipcc web site ipcc

version and progenitor of the ibm pc compatible hardware platform it was introduced on august one one one nine eight one the original model was designated the ibm five one five zero it was created by a team of one two engineers and designers under the direction of don estridge of the ibm entry systems division in boca raton florida the phrase personal computer was common currency before one nine eight one and was used as early as one nine seven two to characterize xerox parc s alto however due to the success of the ibm pc what had been a generic term came to mean specifically a microcomputer compatible with ibm s specification during the second quarter of two zero zero five the chinese lenovo group secured the rights to produce ibm branded personal computers this move reflects ibm s present lack of interest in the personal computer in favor of the server mainframe markets as well as providing business consulting and it services markets note the following distinctions within the general subject of personal computers for details on pc compatible computers aka pc clones or just pc s and making up the majority of today s computers see ibm pc compatible for a discussion of generic personal computers see personal computer for details of the second generation of microcomputers which largely died out with the personal computer revolution see home computer the ibm pc concept the original pc was an ibm attempt to get into the home computer market then dominated by the apple ii and a host of cp m machines rather than going through the usual ibm design process which had already failed to design an affordable microcomputer for example the failed ibm five one zero zero a special team was assembled with authorization to bypass normal company restrictions and get something to market rapidly this project was given the code name project chess the team consisted of just one two people headed by william lowe they succeeded development of the pc took about a year to achieve this they first decided to build the machine with off the shelf parts from a variety of different original equipment manufacturers oems and countries previously ibm had developed their own components second they decided on an open architecture so that other manufacturers could produce and sell compatible machines the ibm pc compatibles so the specification of the rom bios was published ibm hoped to maintain their position in the market by royalties from licensing the bios and by keeping ahead of the competition unfortunately for ibm other manufacturers rapidly reverse engineered the bios to produce their own royalty free versions compaq computer corporation announced the first cloned ibm pc compatible in november one nine eight two it did not ship until march one nine eight three the compaq portable not only was it the first ibm pc compatible computer not manufactured by ibm it was also the first ever ibm pc compatible portable computer once the ibm pc became a commercial success the pc came back under the usual ibm management control with the result that competitors had little trouble taking the lead from them in this regard ibm s tradition of rationalizing their product lines deliberately restricting the performance of lower priced models in order to prevent them from cannibalizing profits from higher priced models worked against them commercial success the first ibm pc was released on august one one one nine eight one although not cheap at a base price of one five six five it was affordable for businesses and it was business that purchased the pc however it was not the corporate computer department that was responsible for this for the pc was not seen as a proper computer it was generally well educated middle managers that saw the potential once the revolutionary visicalc spreadsheet the killer app had been ported to the pc reassured by the ibm name they began buying the machines on their own budgets to help do the calculations they had learned at business school ibm pc models the models of ibm s first generation personal computer pc series have names the original pc had a version of microsoft basic ibm cassette basic in rom the cga color graphics adapter video card could use a standard tv for display the standard storage device was cassette tape a floppy disk drive was an optional extra no hard disk was available it had only five expansion slots maximum memory using ibm parts was two five six kb six four kb on the main board and three six four kb expansion cards the processor was an intel eight zero eight eight second sourced amds were used after one nine eight three running at four seven seven mhz ibm sold it in configurations with one six kb and six four kb of ram preinstalled the original pc failed miserably in the home market but was widely used in business the ibm personal computer xt was an enhanced machine designed for business use it had eight expansion slots and a one zero megabyte hard disk it could take two five six kb of memory on the main board later models were expandable to six four zero kb which combined with the rom made up the full megabyte of memory that the eight zero eight eight could address it was usually sold with a monochrome display adapter mda video card the processor was still a four seven seven mhz intel eight zero eight eight and the expansion bus still eight bit isa with xt bus architecture the ibm personal computer at announced august one nine eight four used an intel eight zero two eight six processor originally at six mhz it had a one six bit isa bus and two zero mb harddrive a faster model running at eight mhz was introduced in one nine eight six ibm made some attempt at marketing it as a multi user machine but it sold mainly as a faster pc for power users early pc ats were plagued with reliability problems in part because of some software and hardware incompatibilities but mostly related to the internal two zero mb hard drive while some people blamed ibm s controller card and others blamed the hard drive manufacturer computer memories international or cmi the ibm controller card worked fine with other drives including cmi s three three megabyte model the problems introduced doubt about the computer and for a while even about the two eight six architecture in general but after ibm replaced the two zero mb cmi drives the pc at proved reliable and became a lasting industry standard cmi quickly went out of business ibm convertible ibm portable ibm pcjr the models of its second generation the ibm personal system two ps two are known by model number model two five model three zero within each series the models are also commonly referenced by their cpu clock rate all ibm personal computers are software compatible with each other in general but not every program will work in every machine some programs are time sensitive to a particular speed class older programs will not take advantage of newer higher resolution display standards technology electronics the main circuit board in an ibm pc is called the motherboard this carries the cpu and memory and has a bus with slots for expansion cards the bus used in the original pc became very popular and was subsequently named isa it is in use to this day in computers for industrial use later requirements for higher speed and more capacity forced the development of new versions the vesa local bus allowed for up to three much faster three two bit cards and the eisa architecture was developed as a backward compatible standard including three two bit card slots but it only sold well in high end server systems the lower cost and more general pci bus was introduced in one nine nine four and has now become ubiquitous the motherboard is connected by cables to internal storage devices such as hard disks floppy disks and cd rom drives these tend to be made in standard sizes such as three five nine zero mm and five two five one three three four mm widths with standard fixing holes the case also contains a standard power supply unit psu which is either an at or atx standard size intel eight zero eight six and eight zero eight eight based pcs require ems expanded memory boards to work with more than one megabyte of memory the original ibm pc at used an intel eight zero two eight six processor which can access up to one six megabytes of memory though standard dos applications cannot use more than one megabyte without using additional apis intel eight zero two eight six based computers running under os two can work with the maximum memory keyboard the original one nine eight one ibm pc s keyboard was severely criticised by typists for its non standard placement of the return and left shift keys in one nine eight four ibm corrected this on its at keyboard but shortened the backspace key making it harder to reach in one nine eight seven it introduced the enhanced keyboard which relocated all the function keys and the ctrl keys the esc key was also relocated to the opposite side of the keyboard an ibm pc compatible may have a keyboard which does not recognize every key combination a true ibm pc does e g shifted cursor keys in addition the compatible vendors sometimes used proprietary keyboard interfaces preventing you from replacing the keyboard see also keyboard layout character set the original ibm pc used the seven bit ascii alphabet as its basis but extended it to eight bits with nonstandard character codes this character set was not suitable for some international applications and soon a veritable cottage industry emerged providing variants of the original character set in various national variants in ibm tradition these variants were called code pages these codings are now obsolete having been replaced by more systematic and standardized forms of character coding such as iso eight eight five nine one windows one two five one and unicode this was the original ibm pc character set seven align center eight

ibm compatibles soon became available with very large storage capacities if a hard disk was added that was not compatible with the existing disk controller a new controller board had to be plugged in some disks were integrated with their controller in a single expansion board in one nine eight four ibm introduced the one two megabyte dual sided floppy disk along with its at model although often used as backup storage the high density floppy was not often used for interchangeability in one nine eight six ibm introduced the seven two zero kb double density three five microfloppy disk on its

republic of ireland made up of two six of these northern ireland comprises the remaining six the counties are subdivisions of the ancient provinces of ireland made up in general from smaller territories while the provinces have existed in some form for many centuries the counties developed under the anglo norman and british administrations with the first counties formed in the century after strongbow s arrival and the last wicklow finally formalised in one six zero six the counties were subsequently adopted by sporting and cultural organisations such as the gaelic athletic association which organises its activities on county lines and today they attract strong loyalties particularly in the sporting field the strict definition of what constitutes a county in ireland has been slightly blurred by a growing association of some of the population to their respective administrative county most prominently noticeable due to historical influences in the counties of north tipperary south tipperary and in more recent times the divisions of county dublin dun laoghaire rathdown fingal and south dublin currently the traditional three two counties remain in use as the basis of local identity and sporting loyalties map background the political geography of ireland can be traced with some accuracy from the seventh century at that time ireland was divided into about one five zero different units of government each one called a tuath pl tuatha a tuath was a autonomous group of people of independent political jurisdiction under a chief called sub rege r tuaithe tribal king often the chief of a clan in the sixth century ireland was divided into c ig or fifths sing c ige the four current provinces of ireland were named after four of these c ig uladh ulster laighean leinster connachta connacht and mumha munster the fifth c ige m dh meath corresponded to the present day counties of meath westmeath longford and offaly in present day leinster louth was considered to be part of ulster in bardic lore the fifths of ireland corresponded to the five provinces learning was in the west war in the north wealth in the east music or art in the south and kinship in the centre meath in the one two th century the kings of england began their first of many invasions commonly referred to in ireland as the norman invasion the english governed ireland in a like structure as they did themselves by dividing the country into shires or counties in the late one two th and early one three th centuries to correspond with the subdivisions of the english shires into honors or baronies irish counties were granted out to the angle norman noblemen in cantreds later known as baronies which in turn were subdivided as in england into manors or townlands however in many cases both baronies and townlands correspond to earlier pre norman divisions while there are three three one baronies in ireland divided first into civil parishes there are around six zero zero zero zero townlands that range in size from one to several thousand acres townlands were often traditionally divided into smaller units called quarters but these subdivisions are not legally defined local government main articles districts of northern ireland local government in the republic of ireland the original pattern of three two counties evolved over many years from the original norman conquest of ireland the local government ireland act one eight nine eight was a significant milestone in the framing of the counties and their status some of the three two counties are no longer the main basis for local government planning and community development purposes although unlike the counties in great britain the republic s traditional county boundaries are still respected for other purposes counties on occasion being sub divided in the republic of ireland six of the original two six counties have more than one local authority area producing a total of three four county level authorities county tipperary has been split into north tipperary and south tipperary since one eight nine eight and the formal adoption of the county system for local government in one nine nine four county dublin was split into dun laoghaire rathdown fingal and south dublin by two zero zero two however upon the establishment of county development boards the definition of local government expanded to include the need for a proper identity in each of the new counties the development of which is ongoing of the administrative structures established under the one eight nine eight local government act the only type to have been completely abolished were the rural districts which were rendered void in the early years of the irish free state amidst widespread allegations of corruption on the other hand administrative structures such as town councils and regional authorities created to comply with requirements of the eu exist in parallel with the county system in northern ireland a major re organisation of local government in one nine seven three replaced the six traditional counties and two county boroughs belfast and londonderry by two six single tier districts for local government purposes and these cross the traditional county boundaries the six counties and two county boroughs remain in use for purposes such as lieutenancy they are also used for the royal mail postcode address file administration generally administration follows the three four county level counties and cities of ireland the counties are referred to as county councils and two nine fall into this category the cities of dublin cork limerick galway and waterford have city councils previously as corporations and are administered separately from the counties bearing those names the city of kilkenny is the only city in the republic which does not have a city council it is still a borough but not a county borough and is administered as part of county kilkenny the most recent local government legislation states that kilkenny may retain the title of city for ornament only education the vocational education committee system is based on the traditional counties of the republic of ireland except that county tipperary is separated into north tipperary and south tipperary also each of the cities of dublin cork limerick galway and waterford have their own committee separate from the county d n laoghaire is unique in that it is the only town with a committee the institute of technology system was organised on the committee areas or functional areas these still remain legal but are not as important as originally envisioned as the institutes are now more national in character and are only really applied today when selecting governing councils similarly dublin institute of technology was originally a group of several colleges of the city of dublin committee elections general election areas in the republic of ireland also mostly follow county boundaries called constituencies in accordance with irish law maintaining links to the county system is a mandatory consideration in the re organisation of constituency boundaries this system usually results in more populated counties having several constituencies while others such as sligo and leitrim constitute a single constituency of two counties dublin city and county is subdivded into twelve constituencies local councillors elected to local government are based on similar boundaries to the general election areas however councillors generally run in a particular town council or borough council area which may often encompasses several smaller towns and villages alphabetical list former counties former counties include county coleraine which formed the basis of county londonderry and nether and upper tyrone which were merged and desmond which was split between counties cork and kerry other names seen on old maps include caterlaugh or caterlagh archaic designations of county carlow in the days before much of the north of that county was taken into wicklow in one seven seven seven the ancient norman town of carrickfergus lost its status of county town there was formerly a county of

information security is not confined to computer systems nor to information in an electronic or machine readable form it applies to all aspects of safeguarding or protecting information or data in whatever form the u s national information systems security glossary defines information systems security infosec as the protection of information systems against unauthorized access to or modification of information whether in storage processing or transit and against the denial of service to authorized users or the provision of service to unauthorized users including those measures necessary to detect document and counter such threats most definitions of information security tend to focus sometimes exclusively on specific usages and or particular media e g protect electronic data from unauthorized use in fact it is a common misconception or misunderstanding that information security is synonymous with computer security in any of its guises computer and network security information technology it security information systems security information and communications technology ict security each of these has a different emphasis but the common concern is the security of information in some form electronic in these cases hence all are subsets of information security conversely information security covers not just information but all infrastructures that facilitate its use processes systems services technology etc including computers voice and data networks etc it is an important point that information security is inherently and necessarily neither hermetic nor watertight nor perfectible no one can ever eradicate all risk of improper or capricious use of any information the level of information security sought in any particular situation should be commensurate with the value of the information and the loss financial or otherwise that might accrue from improper use disclosure degradation denial or whatever bruce schneier makes this point in secrets and lies information security is about risk management three widely accepted elements aims principles qualities characteristics attributes of information security are confidentiality integrity availability these can be remembered by the mnemonic cia and is often referred to as the cia triad a simple way to express this is the right information to the right people at the right time a further generally accepted element is accountability historically up to about one nine nine zero confidentiality was the most important element of information security followed by integrity and then availability by two zero zero one changing use and expectation patterns had moved availability to the top of most versions of this priority list the first goal of modern information security has in effect become to ensure that systems are predictably dependable in the face of all sorts of malice and particularly in the face of denial of service attacks nist special publication eight zero zero three three underlying technical models for information technology security added assurance as essential without it the other objectives are not met assurance is the basis for confidence that the security measures both technical and operational work as intended to protect the system and the information in processes and that the other four security objectives integrity availability confidentiality and accountability have been adequately met by a specific implementation some other facets of information security are governance access control risk assessment classification

security income generally defined is the money that is received as a result of the normal business activities of an individual or a business for example for individuals income usually means the gross amount on their payslips before any tax and other deductions has been made by their employer meaning within u s accountancy in u s business and accounting however income most often means the amount of money that a company earns after paying for all its costs outside the u s the term is usually profit or earnings to calculate a company s income it starts with its amount of revenue deducts all costs including such things as employees salaries and depreciation and the number that results is its income which may be a negative number this money is typically reinvested in the business paid in corporate tax and used to pay the owners the shareholders a dividend all public companies are required to provide financial statements on a quarterly basis the statement of income is an important part of this some companies also provide a more rosy financial report of their income with pro forma reporting or ebitda reporting pro forma income is an estimate of how much the company would have earned without including the negative effect of exceptional one time events supposedly in order to show investors how much money the company would have made under normal circumstances if these exceptional one time events had not occurred critics charge that in most cases the one time events are normal business events such as an acquisition of another company or a write off of a cancelled project or division and that pro forma reporting is an attempt to mislead investors by painting a rosy financial picture besides that when discussing results with analysts and shareholders ceos and cfos have a tendency to do even more hypothetical accounting ebitda stands for earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation and is also criticised for being an attempt to mislead investors warren buffett has criticised ebitda reporting famously asking does management think the tooth fairy pays for capital expenditures it is common for some other companies such as real estate investment trusts to present reports using a standard called ffo or funds from operations like ebitda reporting ffo ignores depreciation and amortization this is widely accepted in the industry as real estate values tend to increase rather than decrease over time and many data sites report earnings per share data using ffo meaning within economic science in economics income is the constraint to unlimited consumer purchases consumers can purchase a limited number of goods represented by their budget constraint the basic equation for this is y px x py y where px is the price of good x x is the quantity of good x and y is the income py and y are similar to px and x if you need to examine more than two goods you can add more on this equation tells us two things first if you buy one more of good x you get px py less of good y here px py is known as the rate of substitution secondly if the price of x changes then the rate of substitution changes this causes demand curves to slope down the distribution of

backgrounds easier to learn than any ethnic language this intended usage parallels the actual use of english as a lingua franca unlike english which is a natural and sometimes irregular language ido is specifically designed for grammatical orthographic and lexicographical regularity and to favour no one who might otherwise be advantaged due to native fluency in this sense ido is classified as an international auxiliary language it may be the second most widely used of these after esperanto its predecessor ido was developed in the early one nine zero zero s and retains a small following today primarily in europe it is largely based on esperanto created by l l zamenhof ido first appeared in one nine zero seven as a result of a desire to reform perceived flaws in esperanto that its supporters believed to be a hindrance in its propagation as an easy to learn second language many other reform projects appeared after ido examples such as occidental and novial appeared afterwards but have since faded into obscurity at present ido along with esperanto and interlingua are the only auxiliary languages with a large body of literature and a relatively large speaker base the name of the language likely traces its origin to the ido pronunciation of i d from international delegation see below or the word esperantido descendant of esperanto ido uses the twenty six latin letters used in the english alphabet with no diacritics while still being completely morphologically regular ido resembles the romance languages in appearance and is sometimes mistaken for italian or spanish at first glance ido is largely intelligible to those who have studied esperanto though there are certain differences in word formation grammar and grammatical function words that make it more than a simple reform project ido is a stand alone language after its inception ido gained support estimates generally range around two zero from some in the esperanto community at the time but following the sudden death in one nine one four of one of its most influential proponents louis couturat it declined in popularity there were two reasons for this first the emergence of further schisms arising from competing reform projects and second a general lack of awareness of ido as a candidate for an international language these obstacles weakened the movement and it was not until the rise of the internet that it began to regain its former momentum history photograph of the international ido congress in dessau germany in one nine two two the idea of a universal second language is not a new one and constructed languages are not a recent phenomenon the first known constructed language was created in the one two th century by st hildegard of bingen under the name lingua ignota it was not until the one nine th century however that the idea caught on in large numbers with the language volap k created in one eight seven nine by a german catholic priest named johann martin schleyer volap k though popular for some time and apparently with users numbering in the thousands was later eclipsed by the popularity of esperanto which arose from zamenhof s book unua libro in one eight eight seven the simpler grammar of esperanto appealed to many and its popularity quickly rose the world s first congress of esperanto was held in one nine zero five however some within the esperanto community itself felt that the language should undergo further reform before being officially selected as a universal second language it was at this time that couturat formed the delegation for the adoption of an international auxiliary language this delegation made a formal request to the international association of academies in vienna to select an international language the request was rejected in may one nine zero seven the delegation thereupon decided to meet as a committee in paris in october one nine zero seven to discuss the adoption of a standard international language among the various competitors that had been devised up to that time according to the minutes of the committee it was decided that no language was completely acceptable but that esperanto could be accepted on condition of several modifications to be realized by the permanent commission in the direction defined by the conclusions of the report of the secretaries couturat and leopold leau and by the ido project this anonymous ido project was later suggested to have been primarily devised by couturat with some help from esperanto s representative before the committee louis de beaufront beaufront had himself argued for reforming esperanto prior to having been selected to the delegation his eventual conversion to the ido camp upon the presentation of that language was thus consistent with his earlier positions early supporters of esperanto tended to resist reforms and the language s inventor l l zamenhof deferred to their judgment ironically several of the reforms adopted by ido were themselves proposed at various times by zamenhof especially in one eight nine four when he proposed eliminating the accented letters and the accusative case referring to it as superfluous ballast changing the plural to an italianesque i and replacing the table of correlatives with more latinate words see history of esperanto the custom of keeping the basic rules of esperanto fixed remains today couturat who was the leading proponent of ido was killed in an automobile accident in one nine one four which along with world war i dealt a serious blow to the ido movement although that movement recovered to some degree in the immediate postwar period the whole movement of international languages became balkanized with the publication of an even more europeanized planned language occidental in one nine two two ido went into decline the ido movement lost a majority of its published periodicals in the subsequent year or so and the defection of its major intellectual supporter the danish linguist otto jespersen in one nine two eight on the occasion of the publication of his own planned language novial seemed at the time to provide a quietus some observers trace the eclipse of ido to its hybrid character part esperanto reform project part standard average european in this view once it was clear that ido would neither displace esperanto nor be adopted by the esperanto community many viewed its esperanto like features as unnecessary baggage and moved on to more naturalistic projects those who approved of them tended to return to the larger esperanto community ido s decline had slowed by the one nine three zero s and the movement was still a significant force in interlinguistics during the long gestation of the international auxiliary language association s project like the occidentalists many idists hoped that iala would produce a language relatively close to their own preferences in the end the radically naturalistic interlingua was even farther from ido than occidental and in contrast to occidental there was no major migration of ido supporters to the new language ido s survival during this period was assisted by financial resources accumulated during its heyday e g the chemist wilhelm ostwald had donated the proceeds of his one nine zero nine nobel prize to an ido foundation the language still has active speakers today and the internet has sparked a renewal of interest in the language in recent years the estimates of the number of speakers range from two five zero to five zero zero zero in comparison esperanto has at least one zero zero zero zero zero culbert s widely cited estimate of one six million speakers is controversial jespersen who was present during the ten days of committee deliberations in paris and later served as part of the permanent commission wrote a history of ido a number of esperanto supporters have attacked ido over the years the esperantist don harlow has characterized ido s founders as underhanded and conspiratorial however most ido partisans argue that harlow s history is polemical and does not jibe with all the eyewitness accounts such as those reported by jespersen harlow claims to base his account on material from some other eyewitnesses such as emile boirac and gaston moch and with other source documentation such as zamenhof s correspondence with couturat and others during the period to which jespersen he says did not have access comparison with esperanto main article esperanto and ido compared in spite of the fact that ido technically ranks among the three largest constructed languages in the world its user base is much smaller than that of esperanto to the extent that the average person has never heard of the language in contrast to this many people who have never bothered to learn esperanto still have an idea of its existence its goals as a language and perhaps even a general idea of how the language itself works because of this often the easiest way to explain ido is to first show in what way it differs from esperanto ido inherits many features of the grammar of esperanto and in many cases the vocabulary is similar ido shares with esperanto the goals of grammatical simplicity and consistency ease of learning and the use of loanwords from various european languages the two languages to a great extent are mutually intelligible however certain changes were introduced to address some of the concerns that had arisen about esperanto these include esperanto s alphabet uses six non latin letters three of which are not found in any other existing language as a result esperanto in typing and in internet e mail and newsgroups frequently resorts to any of several schemes to represent these special letters this leads to the situation where the same word may be displayed any of several different ways ido addresses this issue by using the two six letter latin alphabet with two digraphs ch and sh instead of esperanto s and the digraph qu representing as in english quick is used instead of esperanto kv and likewise gu is used instead of gv ido orthography is phonetic in the sense that each written word has an unambiguous pronunciation but it does not have the one to one correspondence between letters and phonemes that esperanto has ido generally does not impose rules of grammatical agreement between grammatical categories within a sentence believing them to be grammatically complex and redundant in a potential universal second language for example in esperanto the verb in a sentence is invariable regardless of the number and person of the subject this principle was not extended in esperanto to adjectives and nouns however as a result in esperanto an adjective must agree in number and case with the noun it modifies as with the french grands livres large books where the adjective must be pluralized as well as the noun there is no such requirement in english for example where number is emphasized by variation of the verb and ido eliminates this feature from its grammar esperanto requires the use of the n ending to signify the use of the accusative case ido allows the use of this feature in ambiguous situations where the object of a sentence does not follow the subject but in all other situations the accusative case was eliminated as redundant ido imposes consistent rules on the use of endings to transform a word from one meaning or part of speech to another thus simplifying the amount of vocabulary memorization that is necessary ido unlike esperanto does not assume the male sex as the default for family relationship words and thus does not for example derive the word for sister by adding a feminine suffix to the word for brother as standard esperanto does instead some relationship root words are defined as sex neutral and two different suffixes derive masculine and feminine specific words from the root frato sibling fratulo brother fratino sister in other cases ido has two or three root words where esperanto has one genitoro parent patro father matro mother ido s vocabulary attempts to use cognates that are shared in common by as many of its six source languages as possible nevertheless modern esperanto has received some influence from ido in areas such as a clarification of the rules for word derivation and suffixes like oz abundant in and end required to phonology ido has the same typical five vowel system a e i o u have their ipa values as esperanto and most of the same consonants omitting two consonant phonemes used by esperanto ipa and the distinctions between and between carry a very low functional load in esperanto and so were deemed to be unnecessary in ido without those two consonant phonemes the consonants in the language are as follows the accent rule in ido is regular but slightly more complex than that of esperanto all polysyllables are stressed on the penultimate second from last syllable except for verb infinitives which are stressed on the ultimate syllable sko lo ka fe o and ler nas for school coffee and learn but i rar sa var and drin kar for to go to know and to drink grammar each word in the ido vocabulary is built from a root word a root word consists of a root and a grammatical ending other words can be formed from that word by removing the grammatical ending and adding a new one or by inserting certain affixes between the root and the grammatical ending as with esperanto ido is grammatically invariable there are no exceptions in ido unlike in natural languages some of the grammatical endings are defined as follows these are the same as in esperanto except for i ir ar or and ez esperanto marks noun plurals by an agglutinative ending j so plural nouns end in oj uses i for verb infinitives esperanto infinitives are tenseless and uses u for the imperative verbs in ido do not conjugate depending on person number or gender the as is and os endings suffice whether the subject is i you he she they or anything else syntax ido word order is generally the same as english subject verb object so the sentence me havas la blua libro is the same as the english i have the blue book both in meaning and word order there are a few differences however adjectives can be written either before the noun as in english or after the noun as in french thus me havas la libro blua is also permissible ido has the optional n accusative ending that is used when the object of the sentence is not clear or it may be used to alter word order when desired la blua libron me havas is another acceptable way of saying the same thing negation occurs in ido by simply affixing ne to the front of a verb me ne havas libro means i do not have a book this as well does not vary and thus the i do not he does not they do not before a verb are simply me ne il ne and li ne in the same way past tense and future tense negatives are formed by ne in front of the conjugated verb i will not go and i did not go become me ne iros and me ne iris respectively yes no questions are formed by the particle ka in front of the question i have a book me havas libro becomes ka me havas libro do i have a book ka can also be placed in front of a noun without a verb to make a simple question corresponding to the english is it ka mark can mean are you mark is it mark do you mean mark depending on the context pronouns the pronouns of ido were revised to make them more acoustically distinct than those of esperanto which all end in i especially the singular and plural first person pronouns mi and ni may be difficult to distinguish in a noisy environment so ido has me and ni instead ido also distinguishes between intimate tu and formal vu second person singular pronouns as well as plural second person pronouns vi not marked for intimacy furthermore ido has a pan gender third person pronoun lu it can mean he she or it depending on the context in addition to its masculine il feminine el and neuter ol third person pronouns ci and thou while technically the familiar form of the word you in esperanto and english respectively are almost never used results on google have shown that while tu is only slightly less common than vu in ido ci is used less than half of one percent of the amount vi is in esperanto esperanto s inventor himself did not include the pronoun in the first book on esperanto and only later reluctantly later he recommended against using ci on the grounds that different cultures have conflicting traditions regarding the use of the familiar and formal forms of you and that a universal language should avoid the problem by simply using the formal form in all situations unlike some other languages that use a formal second person pronoun vi is not capitalized tiu though not a pronoun is usually used in this circumstance because many people have a hard time applying it to humans it should be noted that ol like english it and esperanto i is not limited to inanimate objects but can be used for entities whose sex is indeterminate babies children humans youths elders people individuals horses cows cats etc lu is often mistakenly labeled an epicene pronoun that is one that refers to both masculine and feminine beings but in fact lu is more properly a pan gender pronoun as it is also used for referring to inanimate objects from kompleta gramatiko detaloza di la linguo internaciona ido by beaufront lu like li is used for all three genders that lu does duty for the three genders at will in the singular is not in itself any more astonishing than seeing li serve the three genders at will in the plural by a decision one five five eight the idist academy rejected every restriction concerning the use of lu one may thus use that pronoun in exactly the same way for a thing and a person of obvious sex as for animals of unknown sex and a person that has a genderless name like baby child human etc these being as truly masculine as feminine the motives for this decision were given in mondo xi six eight lu for the singular is exactly the same as li for the plural logic symmetry and ease demand this consequently just as li may be used for people animals and things whenever nothing obliges one to express the gender so lu may be used for people animals and things under the same condition the proposed distinction would be a bothersome subtlety vocabulary vocabulary in ido is based on words that give the greatest facility to the most number of speakers during its inception the first five zero zero zero roots were analyzed compared to the vocabulary of english french spanish german russian and italian and the following result was found two zero two four roots three eight belong to six languages nine four two roots one seven belong to five languages one one one one roots two one belong to four languages five eight five roots one one belong to three languages four five four roots eight belong to two languages two five five roots five belong to one language total five three seven one one zero zero in addition a comparison of ido vocabulary to the six shows the following for the similarities of ido to the six languages above french four eight eight zero nine one italian four four five four eight three spanish four two three seven seven nine english four two one nine seven nine german three three zero two six one russian two eight two one five two this is consistent with the fact that ido is sometimes mistaken for french italian or spanish at first sight comparison of vocabulary with the six languages vocabulary in ido is often created through a number of official prefixes and suffixes that alter the meaning of the word this allows a user to take existing words and modify them to create neologisms when necessary and allows for a wide range of expression without the need to learn new vocabulary each time though their number is too large to be included in one article some examples include the diminutive suffix et domo house becomes dometo cottage and libro book becomes libreto novelette or short story the pejorative suffix ach domo becomes domacho hovel and libro becomes libracho a shoddy piece of work pulp fiction etc the prefix retro which implies a reversal irar to go becomes retroirar to go back backward and venar becomes retrovenar to return new vocabulary is generally created through an analysis of the word its etymology and reference to the six source languages if a word can be created through vocabulary already existing in the language then it will usually be adopted without need for a new radical such as wikipedio for wikipedia which consists of wiki enciklopedio for encyclopedia and if not an entirely new word will be created the word alternatoro for example was adopted in one nine two six likely because five of the six source languages used largely the same orthography for the word and because it was long enough to avoid being mistaken for other words in the existing vocabulary adoption of a word is done through consensus after which the word will be made official by the union care must also be taken to avoid homonyms if possible and usually a new word undergoes some discussion before being adopted foreign words that have a restricted sense and are not likely to be used in everyday life such as the word intifada to refer to the conflict between israel and palestine are left untouched and often written in italics ido speaking community the vast majority of ido speakers find out about the language after learning about esperanto and so the percentage of idists who know esperanto is much higher than vice versa the largest number of ido speakers are found in germany france and spain as with all constructed languages gauging the number of speakers of ido is an extremely difficult task moreover it is also necessary to distinguish between the number of ido speakers and ido supporters ido resembles esperanto and many esperantists have learned ido out of curiosity while still not using it preferring to support the more well known esperanto movement instead on one esperanto bulletin board was written the following which sums this up well mi provis idon anta esperanto kaj alvenis konklude la diferoj estas efike trivialaj komparite al pli gravaj koncerna oj kiujn mi ne detalos i tie pro tio mi elektis subteni esperanton kaj ne subteni idon kvankam eble mi lernos idon por hobio tamen via id vortoj estas bone komprenebla al mi kaj mi uzus idon se ne ekzistis tre pli subtenita lingvo i tried ido before esperanto and came to conclude that the differences are in fact trivial compared to larger concerns that i will not go into detail about here for that the larger speaker community and volume of material i chose to support esperanto and not to support ido though i will be able to learn ido as a hobby however your writing in ido responding to an ido speaker is comprehensible to me and i would use ido if there did not exist a much more supported language it is possible to find trilingual discussions of this nature on the internet in english esperanto and ido each understanding the other with little problem a number of esperantists viewed the schism of ido as a mixed blessing and a number of writings show that some were inversely glad to see those who were interested only in creating a perfect language by constantly reforming it leave the fold so that those remaining could work on using and promoting the language itself however these constant reformers eventually moved on to other reform projects few of which survived much beyond the deaths of the authors themselves and ido has remained constant since then it is safe to say that were ido a community of language reformers during its early days that this is not the case anymore a small sample of two four idists during late two zero zero five showed that five seven had begun their studies of the language during the past three years three two from the mid one nine nine zero s to two zero zero two and eight had known the language from before language examples la princeto the little prince chapter one seven of the little prince the conversation between the little prince and the snake upon his arrival on earth the title

in which the actors perform spontaneously without a script modern improvisation began in the classroom with the theatre games of viola spolin and keith johnstone in the one nine five zero s then evolved quickly to become an independent artform worthy of presentation before a paying audience in all forms of improvisation the actors invent discover the dialogue and action as they perform the unpredictable nature of such a performance lends itself naturally to comedy which might go somewhat towards explaining why the overwhelming majority of improvisational theatre is comedic not dramatic dramatic improv is used by many companies and artists as a means of generating text and content for later performance this is sometimes referred to as organic theatre and is especially favored by creators of political theatre experimental theatre and practitioners of drama therapy improvisation is often found used in actor training as well modern improvisational comedy as it is practiced in the west falls generally into two categories shortform and longform improv process improvisational theatre allows an active relationship with the audience often absent from scripted theatre frequently improv groups will solicit suggestions from the audience as a source of inspiration a way of getting the audience excited and involved and as a means of proving that the performance is not scripted a charge often aimed at the masters of the art whose performances seem so effortless and detailed that those new to improv are convinced it must have been planned much of this success can be attributed to the level of cooperation and agreement these improvisers bring to the stage in order for an improvised scene to be successful the actors involved must work together responsively to define the parameters and action of the scene with each spoken word or action in the scene an actor makes an offer meaning that he or she defines some element of the reality of the scene this might include giving another character a name identifying a relationship location or using mime to define the physical environment these activities are also known as endowment it is the responsibility of the other actors to accept the offers that their fellow performers make to not do so is known as blocking which usually prevents the scene from developing some performers may deliberately block or otherwise break out of character for comedic effect this is known as gagging but this generally prevents the scene from advancing and is frowned upon by many improvisers accepting an offer is usually accompanied by adding a new offer often building on the earlier one this is a process improvisers refer to as yes and and is considered the cornerstone of improvisational technique for example an improv scene might begin with these lines adam i m proud of all the work you ve done here on the farm junior bill yes and i m proud of you for giving up the moonshine pa the unscripted nature of improv also implies no predetermined knowledge about the props that might be useful in a scene improv companies may have at their disposal some number of readily accessible props that can be called upon at a moment s notice but many improvisers eschew props in favor of the infinite possibilities available through mime as with all improv offers actors are encouraged to respect the validity and continuity of the imaginary environment defined by themselves and their fellow performers this means for example taking care not to walk through the table or miraculously survive multiple bullet wounds from another improviser s gun because improv actors may be required to play a variety of roles without preparation they need to be able to construct characters quickly with physicality gestures accents voice changes or other techniques as demanded by the situation the actor may be called upon to play a character of a different age or sex character motivations are an important part of successful improv scenes and improv actors must therefore attempt to act according to the objectives that they believe their character seeks many improvisational actors also work as scripted actors

station is located in orbit around the earth at an altitude of approximately three six zero km two two zero miles a type of orbit usually termed low earth orbit the actual height varies over time by several kilometres due to atmospheric drag and reboosts it orbits earth in a period of about nine two minutes by june two zero zero five it had completed more than three seven five zero zero orbits since launch of the zarya module on november two zero one nine nine eight in many ways the iss represents a merger of previously planned independent space stations russia s mir two united states space

already at present the station has a capacity for a crew of three so far all members of the expedition crews have come from the russian or united states space programs the iss has however been visited by many more astronauts a number of them from other countries and by three space tourists history initially planned as a nasa space station freedom and promoted by president reagan it was found to be too expensive after the end of the cold war it was taken up again as a joint project of nasa and russia s rosaviakosmos on december one one nine eight seven nasa announced the names of four u s

sergei krikalev to construct the station the large components are almost entirely completed on earth so that when they are launched into orbit the amount of installation required by the astronauts on the iss is minimal the components are usually launched in the large cargo bay of the nasa space shuttle currently the assembly sequence is just under half complete as of two zero zero six the station is only able to accommodate three permanent crew members compared to the expected seven that the completed station will hold the iss has been far more expensive than originally anticipated by nasa its construction is also behind schedule largely due to the halting of all nasa shuttle flights following the columbia disaster in early two zero zero three for the two and a half years that the nasa space shuttle fleet was grounded crew rotation continued on the station through the use of the russian soyuz spacecrafts although the science conducted aboard was very limited construction of the station was scheduled to resume in two zero zero six following a few return to flight missions like sts one one four unfortunately the reappearance of the foam debris problem on the sts one one four mission in july two zero zero five the same that doomed columbia has again delayed the launch sequence and has even called into question the future of the space station further aggravating the construction of the iss the plant where the space shuttle s external fuel tank is made is located near new orleans louisiana and was damaged by hurricane katrina building the iss iss assembly sequence

will eventually support the prominent solar arrays criticism of the iss there are many critics of nasa who view the project as a waste of time and money inhibiting progress on more useful projects for instance the estimated one zero zero billion usd lifetime cost could pay for dozens of unmanned scientific missions or could be used for space exploration in general or be better spent on problems on earth critics complain that very little high quality scientific research has been done on the iss and that if the station s scientific program had had to compete with other scientific research in the normal process of peer review and grant applications it would have never been funded the recent problems of the shuttle program have put the iss in a precarious position in which its inhabitants spend most of their time trying to survive rather than doing scientific research so far the costs have been two six billion of which the us share consists mainly of costs related to the space shuttle not expenses nasa incurred by building elements or maintaining the iss however critics say that the main justification for the shuttle program is to service the iss while the main justification for the iss is to give the shuttle somewhere to go with the cancellation of parts of the iss such as the centrifuge accommodations module or node three and the shift of the european robotic arm and the science power platform to a launch by a russian proton rocket nasa s iss expenses excluding shuttle assembly flight costs are expected to be much lower than the one zero zero billion figure that is often used in the media advocates of space exploration say that criticism of the iss project is short sighted and that manned space research and exploration have produced billions of dollars of tangible benefits to people on earth by some estimates the indirect economic benefits made from commercialization of technologies developed during manned space exploration have returned many times the initial investment to the economy however there is no consensus among economists on how to make such an estimate since it requires speculation as to what the tax money would have accomplished had it remained in the economy whether the iss as distinct from the wider space program will be a major contributor in this sense is thus a subject of debate more cynical advocates have pointed out that even if its scientific value is nil it would have still served to force international cooperation at a time of tough international politics two technical aspects of the iss s design have been heavily criticized one it requires too much maintenance and in particular too much maintence through risky expensive evas two its orbit is too highly inclined making it difficult to reach from the earth s surface in an economical way the latter decision arose from the political realities of the us s desire to keep russia involved in the program space tourism weddings and the iss the iss has seen the first space tourist dennis tito who spent two zero million usd to fly aboard a russian supply mission and the first space wedding when yuri malenchenko on the station married ekaterina dmitriev who was in texas present status of the iss the space shuttle discovery is seen here approaching the international space station after the breakup of columbia on february one two zero zero three and the subsequent two and a half year suspension of the us space program followed by problems with resuming flight operations in two zero zero five there remains some uncertainty over the future of the iss due to weight restrictions and design constraints payloads intended for the shuttle even if ready to fly cannot be launched to the station on any other available launcher in addition assembly work is manpower intensive making it difficult to do without the assistance of eva teams brought up by the shuttle in the meantime crew exchange has been carried out using the russian soyuz spacecraft starting with expedition seven two astronaut caretaker crews have been launched instead of the previous crews of three however soyuz lacks the raw cargo space of the shuttle and cannot carry a significant amount of material back to earth because the iss had not been visited by a shuttle for an extended period a large amount of waste accumulated which temporarily hindered station operations the space shuttle program resumed flight on two six july two zero zero five with sts one one four the return to flight mission of discovery this mission to the iss was intended to both test new safety measures implemented since the columbia disaster and to deliver supplies to the station although the mission succeeded safely it was not without risk foam was shed by the external tank leading nasa to

being called qfwfq narrates the stories each of which is a memory of an event in the history of the universe the most well known is probably the first one the distance of the moon which takes the fact that the moon used to be much closer to the earth and builds it into a romantic story about two men and one woman in a tribe of people who used to jump up onto the moon when it passed overhead some other stories the aquatic uncle a tale on the fact that at one stage in evolution animals left the sea and came to live on land the story is about a family living on land that is a bit ashamed of their old uncle who still lives in the sea refusing to come ashore like civilized people the light years is one story is about qfwfq looking at other galaxies and spotting one with a sign pointed right at him saying i saw you given that there s a gulf of one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero light years he checks his diary to find out what he had been doing that day and finds out that it was something he wished to hide then he starts to worry all at one point the fact that all matter and creation used to exist in a single point naturally we were all there old qfwfq said where else

characters with very human qualities one nine six five books ia three two sometimes generically called x eight six three two is the instruction set architecture of intel s most successful microprocessors within various programming language directives it is also referred to as i three eight six the term may be used to refer to the three two bit extensions to the original x eight six architecture or to the architecture as a whole this architecture defines the instruction set for the family of microprocessors installed in the vast majority of personal computers in the world the term means intel architecture three two bit which distinguishes it from the one six bit versions of the architecture that preceded it and the six four bit architecture ia six four which is very different although it has an ia three two compatibility mode the more generic name for all one six and three two bit versions of this architecture is x eight six intel was the inventor and is the biggest supplier of processors compatible with this instruction set but it is not the only supplier of such processors the second biggest supplier is amd and then there are numerous even smaller more specialized suppliers of these processors this instruction set was introduced in the intel eight zero three eight six microprocessor in one nine eight five this instruction set is still the basis of most pc microprocessors twenty years later in two zero zero five even though the instruction set has remained intact the successive generations of microprocessors that run it have become much faster at running it the ia three two instruction set is usually described as cisc complex instruction set computer architecture though such classifications have become less meaningful with advances in microprocessor design two memory management models there are two memory access models that ia three two supports one is called real mode and the other is called protected mode in real mode the processor is limited to accessing a total of just over one mb of memory while in protected mode it can access all of its memory real mode the old dos operating system required the real mode to work while newer windows linux and other operating systems usually require the protected mode upon power on aka booting the processor initiates itself into real mode and then it begins loading programs automatically into ram from rom and disk a program inserted somewhere along the boot sequence may be used to put the processor into the protected mode protected mode in protected mode a number of other advantages beyond just the additional memory addressability beyond the dos one mb limit get activated one of them is protected memory which prevents programs from corrupting one another another one is virtual memory which lets programs use more memory than is physically installed on the machine and the third feature is task switching aka multitasking which lets a computer juggle multiple programs all at once to look like they are all running at the same time the size of memory in protected mode is usually limited to four gb however this isn t the ultimate limit of the size of memory in ia three two processors through tricks in the processor s page and segment memory management systems ia three two operating systems may be able to access more than three two bits of address space even without the switchover to the six four bit paradigm one such trick is known as pae physical address extensions virtual eight zero eight six mode there was also a sub mode of operation in protected mode called virtual eight zero eight six mode this is basically a special hybrid operating mode which allowed old dos programs and operating systems to run while under the control of a protected mode supervisor operating system this allowed for a great deal of flexibility in running both protected mode programs and dos programs simultaneously this mode was added only with the ia three two version of protected mode it did not exist previously in the eight zero two eight six one six bit version of protected mode registers the three eight six has eight three two bit general purpose registers for application use there are eight floating point stack registers later processors added new registers with their various simd instruction sets too such as mmx three dnow and sse there are also system registers that are used mostly by operating systems but not by applications usually they are known as segment control debug and test registers there are six segment registers used mainly for memory management the number of control debug or test registers varies from model to model general purpose registers the x eight six general purpose registers are not really as general purpose as their name implies that is because these general purpose registers have some highly specialized tasks that can often only be done by using only one or two specific registers in other architectures any general purpose register can be used for any purpose the x eight six general purpose registers further subdivide into registers specializing in data and others specializing in addressing also a lot of operations can be done either inside a register or directly inside ram without requiring the data to be loaded into a register first the one nine seven zero s heritage of this architecture shows through by this behaviour note with the advent of the six four bit extensions to x eight six in amd six four this odd behaviour has now been cleaned up at least in six four bit mode general purpose registers are now truly general purpose and they can be used interchangeably this does not affect the three two bit architecture however eight bit and one six bit register subsets eight bit and one six bit subsets of these registers are also accessible for example the lower one six bits of the three two bit eax registers can be accessed by calling it the ax register some of the one six bit registers can be further subdivided into eight bit subsets too for example the upper eight bit half of ax is called ah and the lower half is called al similarly ebx is subdivided into bx one six bit which in turn is divided into bh and bl eight bit general data registers all of the four following registers may be used as general purpose registers however each has some specialized purpose as well each of these registers also have one six bit or eight bit subset names eax accumulator with a special interpretation for arithmetic instructions a for accumulator ebx base register used for addressing data in the data segment ecx counter with a special interpretation for loops c for counter edx data register general address registers used only for address pointing they have one six bit subset names but no eight bit subsets ebp base pointer holds the address of the current stack frame esi source index for string operations edi destination index for string operations esp stack pointer holds the top address of the stack eip instruction pointer holds the current instruction address floating point stack registers initially ia three two included floating point capabilities only on add on processors eight zero eight seven eight zero two eight seven and eight zero three eight seven with the introduction of the eight zero four eight six these eight eight zero x eight seven floating point registers known as st zero through st seven are built in to the cpu each register is eight zero bits wide and stores numbers in the extended precision format of the ieee floating point standard these registers are not accessible directly but are accessible like a lifo stack the register numbers are not fixed but are relative to the top of the stack st zero is the top of the stack st one is the next register below the top of the stack st two is two below the top of the stack etc that means that data is always pushed down from the top of the stack and operations are always done against the top of the stack so you couldn t just access any register randomly it has to be done in the stack order simd registers mmx three dnow and sse also added new registers of their own to the ia three two instruction set mmx registers mmx added eight new registers to the architecture known as mm zero through mm seven henceforth referred to as mmn in reality these new registers were just aliases for the existing x eight seven fpu stack registers hence anything that was done to the floating point stack would also affect the mmx registers unlike the fp stack these mmn registers were fixed not relative and therefore they were randomly accessible each of the mmn registers are six four bit integers however one of the main concepts of the mmx instruction set is the concept of packed data types which means instead of using the whole register for a single six four bit integer quadword two three two bit integers doubleword four one six bit integers word or eight eight bit integers byte may be used also because the mmx s six four bit mmn registers are aliased to the fpu stack and each of the stack registers are eight zero bit wide the upper one six bits of the stack registers go unused in mmx and these bits are set to all ones which makes it look like nan s or infinities in the floating point view this makes it easier to tell whether you are working on a floating point data or mmx data three dnow registers three dnow was designed to be the natural evolution of mmx from integers to floating point as such it uses the exact same register naming convention as mmx that is mm zero through mm seven the only difference is that instead of packing byte to quadword integers into these registers one would pack single precision floating points into these registers the advantage of aliasing registers with the fpu registers is that the same instruction and data structures used to save the state of the fpu registers can also be used to save three dnow register states thus no special modifications are required to be made to operating systems which would otherwise not know about sse registers sse discarded all legacy connections to the fpu stack this also meant that this instruction set discarded all legacy connections to previous generations of simd instruction sets like mmx but it freed the designers up allowing them to use larger registers not limited by the size of the fpu registers the designers created eight one two eight bit registers named xmm zero through xmm seven note in amd six four the number of sse xmm registers has been increased from eight to one six but the downside is that operating systems had to have an awareness of this new set of instructions in order to be able to save their register states so intel created a slightly modified version of protected mode called enhanced mode which enables the usage of sse instructions whereas they stay disabled in regular protected mode an os that is aware of sse will activate enhanced mode whereas an unaware os will only enter into traditional protected mode sse is a simd instruction set that works only on floating point values like three dnow however unlike three dnow it severs all legacy connection to the fpu stack because it has larger registers than three dnow sse can pack twice the number of single precision floats into its registers the original sse was limited to only single precision numbers like three dnow the sse two introduced the capability to pack double precision numbers too which three dnow had no possibility of doing since a double precision number is six four bit in size which would be the full size of a single three dnow mmn register at one two eight bit the sse xmmn registers could pack two double precision floats into one register thus sse two is much more suitable for scientific calculations than either sse one or three dnow which were limited to only single precision instructions the full listing of the x eight six machine language mnemonics including integer floating point and simd instructions can be found in the x eight six instruction listings link they are categorized into a chronological and hierarchal format showing when the instructions first became available and what category of instructions they are the original ia three two instruction set has been evolved over time with the addition of the multimedia instruction updates however the ultimate evolution of ia three two was when it was extended again to six four bits but of course at that point it cannot be called ia three two anymore the six four bit extension is called x eight six six four it could not be called ia six four as intel had already used this label for the itanium design a design which is not really an evolution of the ia three two architecture amd s amd six four was the first x eight six six four instruction set designed later intel followed by imitating amd s design with what they call em six four t simd multimedia instruction set updates various generations of ia three two cpus since have added several extensions to the original instruction set they were known technically as simd instruction sets however more colloquially they were known as multimedia instruction sets because they were mainly used in multimedia entertainment software applications the mmx extensions were the first major upgrade this was a set of integer only simd instructions this was co introduced by intel and amd in their pentium mmx and k six processors in one nine nine seven it shared its registers with the x eight seven fpu therefore operating systems did not have to be modified to accept these instructions they automatically worked if the os also supported x eight seven state saving mmx was further upgraded with the addition of floating point simd capabilities with the introduction of three dnow in early one nine nine nine like mmx this set shared its registers with the x eight seven fpu too this extension was introduced by amd in the k six two processor but it was never picked up by intel sse was single precision floating point simd introduced by intel in late one nine nine nine with the introduction of the pentium iii processor unlike three dnow it was not an extension to the mmx extension nor did it share its registers with the x eight seven fpu it required some modifications to operating systems for them to work this added programming inconvenience was made up for by the fact that sse worked unencumbered by any of the old limitations of the x eight seven fpu this instruction set was adopted eventually by amd starting with its athlon xp processor all further extensions to sse will likely be adopted by amd from now on as it will no longer make any extensions to its own three dnow instructions sse two was introduced in early two zero zero one with the introduction of the pentium four processor this was a further upgrade to the original sse adding double precision operations to its bag of tricks sse three was introduced in early two zero zero four in an upgraded version of the pentium four codenamed prescott it featured some minor tweaks to the sse two extensions next generation six four bit instruction sets two new instruction sets can claim to be the six four bit successor to ia three two one of them builds on top of ia three two but has a different name while the other one discards ia three two completely but has a similar name ia six four intel s ia six four architecture is not directly compatible with the ia three two instruction set it completely discards all ia three two instructions and starts from scratch with a completely different instruction set as well as using a vliw design instead of out of order execution ia six four is the architecture used by their itanium line of processors the itanium has hardware support for ia three two though very slow because of the different approach ia three two execution mode is set by the efi program loaded on boot up the nomenclature ia six four means intel architecture six four bit but the connection with ia three two is only in the name amd six four amd s amd six four instruction set aka x eight six six four is largely built on top of ia three two and thus maintains the x eight six family heritage while extending the instruction set amd took the opportunity to clean up some of the odd behaviour of this instruction set that has existed plagued since its earliest one six bit days while the processor is operating in six four bit mode they also doubled the number of general purpose registers from eight to one six and the general purpose registers are now much more truly general purpose registers they also doubled the number of sse registers from eight to one six as well they have also deprecated most of the functionality of the segment registers since their usage has steadily declined even during the ia three two days em six four t by february two zero zero four intel implicitly acknowledged the logic of the amd six four instruction set deriving from it the em six four t instruction set which is very similar to amd six four this extension is compatible with code written for the amd six four intel started using the set starting with the xeon nocona core in two zero zero four introducing it to the desktop market with the pentium four prescott two m in early two zero zero five see also x eight

intel next generation microarchitecture external links free ia three two documentation provided by intel x eight six architecture microprocessors computer architecture recently internalism and externalism have become part of the standard jargon of philosophical discourse and have become central to certain important debates moral philosophy in contemporary moral philosophy internalism is the view that moral beliefs function as a motivating factor that is the internalist believes that there is an internal connection between her belief that x ought to be done and her motivation to do x in the same way an externalist would argue that there is no essential internal connection between moral beliefs and motives i e there s no essential reason that the belief x is wrong leads to a desire not to do x it is likely that this use of these terms comes from w d falk s paper ought and motivation one nine four eight epistemology in contemporary epistemology internalism about justification is the idea that everything necessary to provide justification for a belief is immediately available in consciousness externalism in this context is the view that there are factors other than those which are internal to the believer which can affect the justificatory status of a belief one strand of externalism is loosely called the causal theory of knowledge and reliabilism is sometimes considered to be another strand it is important to distinguish internalism about justification from internalism about knowledge an internalist about knowledge will likely hold that the conditions that distinguish mere true belief from knowledge are similarly internal to the individual s perspective or grounded in the subject s mental states whereas internalism about justification is a widely endorsed view there are few defenders of internalism about knowledge thanks in no small part to gettier and gettier like examples http en wikipedia org wiki gettier problem that suggest that there is more to knowledge than just justified true belief in a short but widely discussed paper published in one nine six three gettier produced examples that seemed to show that owing to an accidental connection between an individual s evidence or reasons and the truth of her belief someone could be justified in believing something true but nevertheless be ignorant one line of argument in favor of externalism begins with the observation that if what justified our beliefs failed to significantly eliminate the risk of error then it does not seem that knowledge would be attainable as it would appear that when our beliefs did happen to be correct this would really be a matter of good fortune while many will agree with this last claim the argument seems inconclusive setting aside sceptical concerns about the possession of knowledge gettier cases have suggested the need to distinguish justification from warrant where warrant is understood as that which distinguishes justified true belief from knowledge by eliminating the kind of accidentality often present in gettier type cases even if something must significantly reduce the risk of error it is not clear why justification is what must fill the bill one of the more popular arguments from internalism begins with the observation perhaps first due to stewart cohen that when we imagine subjects completely cut off from their surroundings thanks to a malicious cartesian demon perhaps we do not think that in cutting these individuals off from their surroundings these subjects cease to be rational in taking things to be as they appear the new evil demon argument for internalism and against externalism begins with the observation that individuals like us on the inside will be as justified as we are in believing what we believe as it is part of the story that these individual s beliefs are not produced by reliable mechanisms or backed by veridical perceptual experiences the claim that the justification of our beliefs depends upon such things appears to be seriously challenged externalists have offered a variety of responses but none appear to have won the hearts and minds of the epistemological community semantics semantic externalism comes in two flavours depending on whether meaning is construed cognitively or linguistically on a cognitive construal externalism is the thesis that what concepts or contents are available to a thinker is determined by her environment or her relation to her environment on a linguistic construal externalism is the thesis that the meaning of a word is environmentally determined likewise one can construe semantic internalism in two ways as a denial of either of these two theses see also linguistic turn and cognitive turn for more about the two construals of meaning twin earth thought experiment swamp man thought experiment philosophy of mind within the context of the philosophy of mind externalism is the theory that the contents of mental states are dependent on their relationship to the external world some mental states such as believing that water is wet and fearing that the queen has been insulted have contents which we can capture using that clauses the content externalist often appeals to observations which are found as early as hilary putnam s seminal the meaning of meaning that we can easily imagine pairs of individuals that are microphysical duplicates embedded in different surroundings who use the same words but mean different things when using them for example suppose that ike and tina s mothers are identical twins and that ike and tina are raised in isolation from one another in indistinguishable environments when ike says i want my mommy he expresses a want that is satisfied only if he is brought to his mommy if we brought tina s mommy ike might not notice the difference but he doesn t get what he wants it seems that what he wants and what he says when he says i want my mommy will be different from what tina wants and what she says she wants when she says i want my mommy externalists say that if we assume that competent speakers know what they think and say what they think the difference in what these two speakers mean will correspond to a difference in the minds of the two speakers that is not necessarily reflected by an internal difference in the internal make up of the speakers or thinkers they urge us to move from externalism about meaning of the sort putnam defended to externalism about contentful states of mind the example offered pertains to singular terms but it has been extended to cover kind terms as well such as terms for kinds of substances e g water and for kinds of artifacts e g espresso maker there is no general agreement amongst content externalists as to the scope of the thesis critics of the view have questioned the original thought experiments saying that the lessons that putnam and later writers such as tyler burge have urged us to draw can be resisted frank jackson and john searle for example have defended internalist accounts of thought content according to which the contents of our thoughts are fixed by descriptions that pick out the individuals and kinds that our thoughts intuitively pertain to the sorts of things that we take them to in the ike tina example one might agree that ike s thoughts pertain to ike s mother and that tina s thoughts pertain to tina s but insist that this is because ike thinks of that woman as his mother and we can capture this by saying that he thinks of her as the mother of the speaker this descriptive phrase will pick out one unique woman externalists have claimed that this is implausible as we would have to ascribe ike knowledge he wouldn t seem to need in order to successfully refer to his mother or think about his mother critics have also claimed that content externalists are committed to epistemological absurdities suppose that a speaker can have the concept of water we do only if the speaker lives in a world that contains h two o it seems this speaker could know apriori that she thinks that water is wet this is the thesis of privileged access it also seems that she could know on the basis of simple thought experiments that she can only think that water is wet if she lives in a world that contains water what would prevent her from putting these together and coming to know apriori that the world contains water if we should say that no one could possibly know whether water exists apriori it seems either we cannot know content externalism to be true on the basis of thought experiments or we cannot know what we are thinking without first looking into the world to see what it is like epistemology ethics semantics philosophy of mind external links internalist vs externalist conceptions of epistemic justification isolationism is a foreign policy which combines a non interventionist military and political policy with a policy of economic nationalism protectionism in other words it asserts both of the following political rulers should avoid entangling alliances with other nations and avoid all wars not related to direct territorial self defense there should be legal barriers to prevent trade and cultural exchange with people in other states the term isolationism was coined by military interventionists as a pejorative term during world war i to refer to people who opposed the united states entry into that war later the term isolationism was used one nine three nine four one to refer to opponents of united states entry into world war ii the two most prominent leaders were charles lindbergh and

international relations the indianapolis colts are a professional american football team based in indianapolis indiana they currently belong to the southern division of the american football conference afc in the national football league nfl the team began play in one nine five three as a second incarnation of the previous baltimore colts team in the nfl the original colts team began play in one nine four six as a charter member of the all america football conference and joined the nfl in one nine five zero after the aafc merged into the older league but folded after the season after fans in baltimore maryland protested the nfl formed this newer colts team while in baltimore the club won three nfl championships and one super bowl prior to the one nine eight four season the colts moved from baltimore to indianapolis highlighted by an infamous incident in which they packed all of their belongings into mayflower transit trucks in the middle of a snowy night on march two eight the move angered many baltimore fans and former players so much that they completely disassociated themselves from the relocated indianapolis team meanwhile the colts have not returned to the super bowl since then uniform colors royal blue and white helmet design white background blue horseshoe franchise history the aafc baltimore colts there have been two unrelated nfl teams called the baltimore colts the first colts team started in the all america football conference in one nine four six as the miami seahawks they moved to baltimore in one nine four seven in one nine five zero they joined the national football league and finished the season with a record of one one one they folded after the one nine five zero season however supporting groups such as a fan club and a marching band remained in operation and worked for the team s revival the nfl baltimore colts the team that is currently the indianapolis colts has taken a long trip to get to where they are today officially the nfl considers the colts to have begun play in one nine five three in baltimore but it was created from the nucleus that had previously been the boston yanks one nine four four one nine four eight new york bulldogs one nine four nine new york yanks one nine five zero one nine five one and the dallas texans one nine five two in one nine five three carroll rosenbloom became the principal owner of the new nfl baltimore colts in one nine five eight coached by hall of famer weeb ewbank and led by hall of fame quarterback johnny unitas the colts defeated the new york giants at yankee stadium two three one seven in the nfl championship game an overtime contest sometimes called the greatest game ever played the colts repeated as nfl champions in one nine five nine beating the giants again three one one six in the early one nine six zero s the colts continued as an elite nfl team although they lost the nfl championship game in one nine six four to the cleveland browns two seven zero the one nine six seven colts entered the final week of the regular season undefeated but then a three four one zero loss to the rams at los angeles kept them out of the playoffs as the result gave both teams a final record of one one one two with the rams being awarded first place in the western conference s coastal division because they won the head to head series the first meeting between the two teams at baltimore ended in a two four two four tie in one nine six eight after a one three one season they gained a measure of revenge against the browns defeating them three four zero in the nfl championship game the one three one regular season and the trouncing of the browns led nfl based media to call the colts the greatest pro football team of all time the colts went into super bowl iii the first in the series to officially be called the super bowl against the american football league s new york jets as one seven point favorites with nfl icons like pro bowlers bobby boyd db mike curtis lb john mackey te tom matte rb fred miller dl earl morrall qb willie richardson wr and bob vogel ol the result of the game was one of the greatest upsets in sports history as joe namath and matt snell led the american football league champion jets to a world championship over the nfl s colts one six seven ironically the jets were coached by weeb ewbank who had previously led the colts to two nfl titles rosenbloom art modell browns and art rooney steelers facilitated the nfl merger with the american football league by joining the ten afl teams in the afc after the nfl merged with the afl in one nine seven zero the colts moved to the american football conference afc and won the afc championship against the oakland raiders two seven one seven baltimore went on to win the first post merger super bowl super bowl v against the nfc s dallas cowboys one six one three on a jim o brien field goal since there was only one league after one nine six nine the colts one nine seven zero super bowl win was the nfl championship as were all super bowls thereafter in one nine seven one the colts made it back to the nfl playoffs they defeated the cleveland browns in the first round but lost to the miami dolphins in the afc championship on january two one nine seven two two one zero on july one three one nine seven two rosenbloom traded the colts to robert irsay for the los angeles rams but the players remained in their same respective cities the colts made the playoffs four more times in the one nine seven zero s a wild card in one nine seven one and three consecutive afc east titles in one nine seven five through one nine seven seven led in these latter years by the nfl s best defensive line known colloquially as the sack pack but then endured nine consecutive losing seasons beginning in one nine seven eight in one nine eight one the defense was the main problem the colts allowed an nfl record five three three points and also set an all time record for fewest sacks one three and a modern record for fewest punt returns one two the following year the offense collapsed on november two eight one nine eight two the colts offense did not cross mid field in an entire game played at buffalo against the bills this would not happen again in an nfl game until two zero zero zero the colts also finished zero eight one in one nine eight two only nine games having been played that year due to a five seven day players strike relocation to indianapolis by early one nine eight four team owner robert irsay threatened to move the team unless baltimore city officials helped pay for a new stadium and other concessions despite numerous public announcements that he would not move the colts out of baltimore and the maryland legislature threatening to give the city of baltimore the right to seize the team by eminent domain irsay secretly negotiated with indianapolis to move the team the indiana capital agreed to give the team a one two five million loan a four million training complex and the use of the hoosier dome after signing the agreement mayflower transit trucks rolled into the team s training complex in the wee hours of march two eight workers then packed and shipped the team s offices and equipment to indianapolis the moved triggered a flurry of legal activity that ended when representatives of baltimore and the colts organization reached a settlement on march one nine eight six in which all lawsuits regarding the relocation would be dismissed and the colts would endorse a new nfl team for baltimore several years later on november six one nine nine five then cleveland browns owner art modell announced his intention to move his browns team to baltimore the decision also triggered a flurry of legal activity that ended when representatives of both cities and the nfl reached a settlement on february nine one nine nine six it stipulated that the browns name colors and history of the franchise were to remain in cleveland a reactivated cleveland browns team would then begin play in one nine nine nine while the relocated club would technically be a new expansion team however the irsay family refused to turn over the baltimore colts name colors and history therefore the new team was named the baltimore ravens after a fan vote when the ravens began play in one nine nine six the nfl continued to regard the pre one nine eight four baltimore colts organization and indianapolis colts as one continuous entity and the ravens as a one nine nine six expansion team however almost all of the prominent former old time baltimore colts players who had disassociated themselves from the relocated indianapolis team started to attend the new baltimore team s games and events they and most baltimore fans who are still disgusted about the colts relocation view the pre one nine eight four colts organization and the ravens as one continuous entity in fact the old baltimore colts marching band and fan club became part of the ravens organization the years in indianapolis since one nine eight four the colts have had mixed success at best they have appeared in the playoffs seven seasons since then with their best advance to the afc championship game in one nine nine five when they lost to the pittsburgh steelers two zero one six and in two zero zero three when they won the afc south division title defeated the denver broncos in the wild card playoff four one one zero and advanced to play the kansas city chiefs in a divisional playoff winning three eight three one in the afc championship game they were decisively defeated two four one four by the eventual super bowl champions the new england patriots with quarterback peyton manning throwing four interceptions in a game which was widely criticized for its minimal officiating only seven penalties were called during the entire game six of them were pre snap fouls two zero zero four season in the two zero zero four season the colts hoped to make another trip to the postseason after losing in week one to the defending champion new england patriots two seven two four in foxboro they won four straight games before their week six bye during that streak they beat the tennessee titans in nashville three one one seven won in the week three home opener against the green bay packers four five three one and then tied for the afc south with a victory over the jacksonville jaguars at alltel stadium two four one seven they won at home against the oakland raiders three five one four but coming off of their bye week the colts lost the next two games they lost the rematch against the jaguars at home two seven two four and lost to the revenge hungry kansas city chiefs four five three five following these back to back defeats the colts began an eight game winning streak they won their next two home games beating the minnesota vikings three one two eight the first was back on week six against the rams on november two zero the colts faced their first real challenge against the carson palmer led bengals in which the colts won four five three seven and became the first team to go one zero zero since the one nine nine eight denver broncos it also marked the third time this year they won with four zero plus points the colts then defeated the pittsburgh steelers two six seven on a monday night football game on november two eight spoiling ben roethlisberger s return from knee surgery and giving him his first road loss on sunday december three the colts swept division rival tennessee titans at home three five three to remain undefeated becoming the first team to qualify for the playoffs the next week they swept the jacksonville jaguars another division rival to clinch the division and the no one playoff seed in the afc which ensured the colts home field advantage this also marked the first time since the one nine nine eight denver broncos and the fourth time in nfl history a team went one three zero on sunday december one eight the san diego chargers defeated the colts two six one seven ending their bid to replace the one nine seven two miami dolphins as the most recent team in the nfl to play an undefeated season in week one six the colts were forced to play without their coach tony dungy who took the week off to mourn the death of his son james presumed to have commited suicide earlier in the week with the team resting most of their key and injured players the colts lost their second straight game two eight one three to the surging seattle seahawks in their last regular season home game of the year the colts again played mostly with their back ups and won against the arizona cardinals one seven one three more importantly this game marked the return of coach dungy the team s final record of one four two marks the best one six game season in the franchise s history on january one five two zero zero six the colts were eliminated from the playoffs in a divisional playoff matchup against the year s super bowl champion pittsburgh steelers they were down two one three and staged a comeback but came up short two one one eight as mike vanderjagt s four six yard field goal attempt sailed wide right this makes the colts only the two nd team to start one zero zero and not make it to the super bowl the other being the one nine nine zero san fransisco four nine ers after the upset loss tony dungy had several people wondering if he would be back for the two zero zero six season a few days later he stated that he would return saying he forgot to mention that in the conference the colts then secured reggie wayne with a six year four zero million dollar contract however it is doubtful to see edgerrin james returning to indianapolis for the two zero zero six season season by season records colspan

six zero zero to the present millions came from europe in the one nine th century from asia africa and latin america in the present day throughout american history immigration has caused controversy regarding the political loyalties and values of people who have moved from one nation to another the british settlers of the colonial era moved from one part of the british empire to another as did the dutch and did not change their nation but the germans did and nearly everyone else did so for statistical purposes in this article everyone who arrived in the colonial period is called an immigrant the puerto ricans who moved to the mainland after one nine four five are not considered immigrants since they were us citizens given the geography most immigrants came long distances however the french canadians who came down from quebec after one eight six zero and the mexicans who came north after one nine one one found it easy to move back and forth indeed with cheap jet travel after one nine six five a return to the country of origin became fast and fairly inexpensive historical immigration colonial era immigration to north america according to the source the source a guidebook of american genealogy by kory l meyerink and loretto dennis szucs the following were the countries of origin for new arrivals coming to the united states before one seven nine zero the regions marked were part of great britain early immigration laws prevented asians and africans from entering the usa legally except as chattels in the latter case for most europeans however immigration was relatively free and unrestricted until the one eight zero zero s and the onset of the industrial revolution voluntary migration from europe the population of the colonies that later became the united states grew from zero europeans in the mid one five zero zero s to four six million europeans and nine zero zero zero zero zero african slaves in one seven nine zero at that time it is estimated that three four of the population were of british descent with germans forming the second largest free ethnic group and making up some seven of the population between one six two nine and one six four zero some two zero zero zero zero puritans emigrated from england most settling in the new england area of north america in an event known as the great migration these people became the yankees of new england who later spread out to new york and the upper midwest from one six zero nine to one six six four some eight zero zero zero dutch settlers peopled the new netherlands which later became new york and new jersey between one six four five and one six seven zero some four five zero zero zero royalists and or indentured servants left england to work in the middle colonies and virginia from about one six seven five to one seven one five the quakers made their move leaving the midlands and north england behind for pennsylvania new jersey and delaware the quaker movement became one of the largest religious presences in early colonial america germans migrated early into several colonies but mostly to pennsylvania where they made up a third of the population by the time of the revolution between about one seven one zero and one seven seven five around one three five zero zero zero irish people left ulster the northern province of ireland and settled in western pennsylvania appalachia and the western frontier these places later would become kentucky and tennessee unfree labor slave trade indentured servitude and convict shipments the majority of african slaves came to the future united states before it gained independence the numbers remain less than clear but it is believed that some three zero zero zero zero zero slaves arrived in the british north american colonies before one seven seven six and some one zero zero zero zero zero were imported in the period between then and one eight six zero the international slave trade was made illegal in one eight zero eight a large number of indentured servants from the british isles ireland and continental europe especially germany came to the future united states during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with the bulk arriving in the half century before one seven seven six most were teenagers who served terms of four to fourteen years and arrived in the colonies of pennsylvania new york and virginia about five zero

immigration in detail between one eight five zero and one nine three zero about five million germans immigrated to the united states with a peak in the years between one eight eight one and one eight eight five when a million germans left germany and settled mostly in the midwest between one eight two zero and one nine three zero three five british mostly protestant and four five million irish mostly catholic entered america before the one eight four zero s most irish immigrants were irish presbyterians or scotch irish after one eight four zero the catholics arrived in large numbers in part because of the famines of the one eight four zero s between one eight four zero and one nine three zero about nine zero zero zero zero zero french canadians left quebec to emigrate to the united states and settled mainly in new england given the quebec population at the time this was a massive exodus one three six million americans claimed to have french ancestry in the one nine eight zero census a large proportion of them have ancestors who emigrated from french canada the years one nine one zero to one nine two zero were the highpoint of italian immigration to the united states over two million italians immigrated in those years with a total of five three million immigrating between one eight two zero and one nine eight zero about a third of them returned to italy after working an average of five years in the us about one five million swedes and norwegians immigrated to the united states within this period due to opportunity in america and poverty and religious oppression in united sweden norway this accounted for around two zero of the total population of the kingdom at that time they settled mainly in the midwest after their arrival in america minnesota in particular has a large proportion of people with swedish and norwegian ancestry danes however had comparably low immigration rates due to a better government and economy most danish immigrants were mormon converts who moved to utah over two million eastern europeans mainly catholics immigrated during the years of one eight eight zero to one nine two four people of polish ancestry are the largest eastern european ancestry group in the united states immigration of eastern orthodox ethnic groups was much lower from one eight eight zero to one nine two four around two million jews moved to the united states mostly seeking better opportunity in america and fleeing the pogroms of eastern europe after one nine three three jews who tried to flee nazi germany were often denied access to the united states highlighted by the event of the s s st louis laws concerning immigration and naturalization the first naturalization law in the united states was the one seven nine five naturalization act which restricted citizenship to free white persons who had resided in the country for five years the next significant change in the law came in one eight seven zero when the law was broadened to allow both whites and african americans though asians were still excluded from citizenship immigration was otherwise unlimited in one eight eight two the chinese exclusion act specifically forbade chinese immigration overturning the one eight six eight burlingame treaty that had encouraged it the temporary ban was extended repeatedly and made permanent in one nine zero four it was the culmination of decades of agitation particularly by californians who had passed their own anti coolie act in one eight six two the ban was deeply resented in asia but was not repealed until one nine four three and only then to reward a world war ii wartime ally in order to avoid the same humiliation the empire of japan negotiated the gentlemen s agreement in one nine zero seven a protocol that required japan to prevent her citizens from emigrating to the u s in exchange for better treatment of those already living there congress also banned persons because of their health beliefs or lack of education an one eight eight two law banned entry of lunatics and infectious disease carriers and the one nine zero one anarchist exclusion act kept people out because of their political beliefs a literacy requirement was added in immigration act of one nine one seven in one nine two one the united states congress passed the emergency quota act establishing national quotas on immigration the quotas were based on the number of foreign born residents of each nationality who were living in the united states as of the one nine one zero census a more complex quota plan replaced this emergency system under the immigration act of one nine two four one major change was that the reference census used was changed to that of one eight nine zero which greatly reduced the number of southern and eastern european immigrants immigrants from most of the western hemisphere however were admitted outside the quota system the immigration and nationality act of one nine five two the mccarran walter act revised the quotas again basing them on the one nine two zero census for the first time in american history racial distinctions were omitted from the u s code nevertheless most of the quota allocation still went to immigrants from ireland the united kingdom and germany the anti subversive features of this law are still in force and have been used to bar the entry of countless individuals based upon their political expressions the immigration and nationality act amendments of one nine six five the hart cellar act abolished the system of national origin quotas there was for the first time a limitation on western hemisphere immigration one two zero zero zero zero per year with the eastern hemisphere limited to one seven zero zero zero zero most of these numbers were allocated to immigrants who were relatives of united states citizens in one nine eight six the immigration reform and control act was passed creating for the first time penalties for employers who hire illegal immigrants irca also contained an amnesty for illegal immigrants already in the united states and mandated the intensification of the activities of the united states border patrol increasing the militarization of the us mexico border by one account the actual number of annual legal immigrants was estimated at five zero zero zero zero zero to six zero zero zero zero zero in one nine eight nine this subsequently increased and is now well over one million annually not including illegal migration or temporary work visas several pieces of legislation signed into law in one nine nine six marked a turn towards harsher policies for both legal and illegal immigrants the anti terrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa and illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira vastly increased the categories of criminal activity for which immigrants including green card holders can be deported and imposed mandatory detention for certain types of deportation cases as a result well over one zero zero zero zero zero zero individuals have been deported since one nine nine six see also list of united states immigration acts contemporary immigration contemporary immigrants settle very predominantly in seven states california new york florida texas pennsylvania new jersey and illinois the combined total immigrant population of these seven states formed seven zero of the total foreign born population as of two zero zero zero there are a number of discernable categories of immigrants to the united states each with unique and shared issues nonimmigrant visas mostly work visas there are a number of employment based temporary visas defined as nonimmigrant visas under the immigration law including the following popular ones among others h one b the h one b classification is for professional level jobs that require a minimum of a bachelor s degree in a specific academic field in addition the employee must have the degree or the equivalence of such a degree through education and experience before the h one b petition can be filed with uscis the employer must file a labor condition application lca with the department of labor demonstrating that it is paying the required wage for this position in the geographic region where the job is located the required wage for the position is the higher of the actual wage that is paid to other employees in this position or the prevailing wage which is determined by government surveys and the state labor office offices as a general rule a person who is in one nonimmigrant status may not change status or change employers in that status until he or she applies with uscis for such a change and such change is granted however a provision called h one b portability permits certain individuals already in the united states in h one b status to commence employment for a new employer once a new employer s h one b petition is filed with uscis at the dawn of the two one st century the controversy revived when many high tech and software engineering workers started to arrive from abroad on h one b visas h one b expansion was widely unpopular but was supported by a number of different groups including campaign donations from corporate interests and from persons who support the arrival of persons from abroad who are highly skilled critics claimed that these visas decreased the wages of american citizens displaced american citizens enabled corporations to enforce extreme workplace discipline and get around laws concerning working conditions created national security problems and increased the risk of transmitting new diseases to the united states however except for isolated cases of abuse these fears are mostly unwarranted in order to obtain an h one b visa the employer must show that it will pay the higher of the prevailing local wage or the wage it pays other u s who have similar education and experience the employer is not required to prove there are no american workers available to perform the work unless the employer has a high percentage of current workers in h one b status h one b dependent however some economists saw h one b expansion as an assault on the american middle class that benefited the wealthy and made it impossible to maintain traditional american standards of living or provide incentives to improve productivity as rapidly as nations like japan with more restrictive immigration policies the companies who imported the workers usually argued that the u s lacked enough american citizens to do the work a few economists argued that whatever the truth of that assertion importing the workers provided more benefits to the u s and otherwise the recruiting companies would simply offshore the entire operation it was claimed this would likely prove worse for the u s economy as a whole because in the first scenario foreign national workers living in the united states would at least spend money in the united states while the multi national corporations that would purportedly export the jobs to overseas locations would probably not pass down as much of the savings to the u s consumer who purchased for them l one intracompany transferee the l one

visas and life act for spouses of legal permanent residents green card holders unification of legal permanent residents lprs a k a green card holders with their spouses continues to stay under the radar screens of policy makers the issue of lawful permanent residents torn from their families for years is not a new problem a mechanism to unite families of lprs was created by the legal immigration family equity act of two zero zero zero the life act by the introduction of a v visa signed into law by president bush unfortunately it effectively expired and is no longer available legal permanent residents who have opted to get married to foreigners are unable to be united with their spouses and young families the foreign spouse of a us green card holder must wait for approval of an immigrant visa from the state department before entering the us due to a backlog in processing such visas can take a upwards of five years to be approved in the interim the spouse cannot enter the us on any other visas or as visitors lprs are in a uniquely disadvantaged situation visitors and non immigrants coming to the us on temporary visas for work business or studies including on h one l one b and f one visas can sponsor their dependant spouses to travel along with them american citizens can sponsor their spouses to come to the us in non immigrant status and then convert to an immigrant status under the legal immigration and family equity act the life act adjustment of status adjustment of status is the final step of what is commonly called the green card process i e that of becoming a legal permanent resident it requires that the foreign national in question file an i four eight five application for adjustment of status most often based on a preexisting and approved or approvable i one four zero immigrant petition for alien worker or i one three zero petition for alien relative due to comprehensive immigration reform in two zero zero two i four eight five applications and i one three zero or i one four zero petitions may be filed concurrently given the immediate availability of an immigrant visa number the application must be filed with an i six nine three medical examination of alien issued by a licensed civil surgeon and a g three two five a biographic information form which documents provide a complete medical and immunological history as well as a record of the foreign national s places of employment and residence for the last five years the uscis then sets a date for the foreign national to have their fingerprints picture and signature recorded for their fbi background check and entry in the uscis database an interview with an uscis officer is required in the vast majority of cases a pending adjustment of status application entitles the applicant to work and travel authorization in the forms of an employment authorization document ead card and advance parole documents that must be renewed on a yearly basis the application may be considered abandoned if the applicant does not attend a biometrics appointment or interview applications may also be denied for any of the following reasons the underlying immigrant petition is denied or withdrawn the applicant is found to have entered or resided in the united states illegally although this is waived for one who originally entered with a valid visa and is an immediate relative of the us citizen petitioner the applicant is judged as undesirable on the grounds of prior criminal convictions affiliation with unsuitable political parties or organizations e g former members of the communist party poor character or debilitating health problems as well as other grounds if an adjustment application is approved a permanent residency card green card valid for ten years is issued to the applicant legal permanent residents lprs are free to work and reside in the united states and may leave and re enter without a visa although they are required to present the green card at the port of entry to an immigration officer after five years lprs are eligible to apply for naturalization except that an lpr who obtained the green card through marriage may apply for naturalization after three years if he or she is still living with the same spouse who originally filed the petition for the lpr political asylum in contrast to economic refugees who generally do not gain legal admission other classes of refugees can gain legal status through a process of seeking and receiving political asylum either by being designated a refugee while abroad or by physically entering the united states and requesting asylee status thereafter asylum is offered as part of the united states obligation under the one nine five one convention relating to the status of refugees and the one nine six seven protocol relating to the status of refugees under these agreements a refugee is a person who is outside his or her country of nationality or place of habitual residence if stateless who owing to a fear of persecution on account of a protected ground is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of the state protected grounds include race nationality religion political opinion and membership of a particular social group the signatories to these agreements are obliged not to return or refoul refugees to the place where they would face persecution advocates of refugee protection claim that for the most part such persons are fleeing warfare escaping persecution based on political or religious beliefs or are victims of torture in their countries of origin critics claim the process has been widely abused and large numbers of people claim persecution simply to obtain the benefits of living in the united states the primary benefit for such an asylum applicant is the eligibility for a work permit employment authorization by simply filing an application for asylum with uscis former ins to the later dismay of a large number of these applicants however if their claims of persecution are not backed up by genuine evidence or proofs the claims are eventually denied and they are placed in removal deportation proceedings in the immigration court since the effective date of the one nine nine six iirira legislation an applicant must apply for asylum within one year of entry or be barred from doing so unless there were certain exceptional circumstances some asylum cases have been also granted based on sexual orientation or gender where cultural norms of the home country create and sustain conditions that make life unsafe or unbearable for the individual as of two zero zero four recipients of political asylum faced a wait of approximately one four years to receive permanent resident status after receiving their initial asylee status because of an annual cap of one zero zero zero zero green cards for this class of individuals however in may two zero zero five under the terms of a proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit ngwanyia v gonzales brought on behalf of asylees against uscis the government agreed to make available an additional three one zero zero zero green cards for asylees during the period ending on september three zero two zero zero seven this is in addition to the one zero zero zero zero green cards allocated for each year until then this should speed up the green card waiting time considerably for asylees however the issue is rendered somewhat moot since the enactment of the real id act of two zero zero five division b of united states public law one zero nine one three h r one two six eight eliminated the cap on annual asylee green cards and currently an asylee who has continuously resided in the us for more than one year in that status has an immediately available visa number miscellaneous legal immigration in removal proceedings deportation in front of an immigration judge cancellation of removal is a form of relief that is available for certain long time residents of the united states it allows a person being faced with the threat of removal to obtain permanent residence if that person one has been physically present in the u s for at least ten years two has had good moral character during that period three has not been convicted of certain crimes and four can show that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his or her us citizen permanent resident spouse children or parent unfortunately this form of relief is only available when a person is served with a notice to appear like a civil summons to appear in the proceedings in the immigration court many persons have received their green cards in this way even though removal or deportation was looming member of congress may submit private bills granting residency to specific named individuals a special committee vets the requests which require extensive documentation congress has bestowed the title of honorary citizen of the united states to six people the only two living recipients were winston churchill and agnes gonxha bojaxhiu mother teresa the other instances were posthumous honors the central intelligence agency has the statutory authority to admit up to one hundred people a year outside of normal immigration procedures and to provide for their settlement and support the program is called pl one one zero after the legislation that created the agency public law one one zero the central intelligence agency act illegal immigration one consequence of laws restricting the number and ethnicity of persons entering the usa is a phenomenon referred to as illegal immigration in which persons enter a country and obtain work without legal sanction in some cases this is accomplished by entering the country legally with a visa and then simply choosing not to leave upon expiration of the visa in other cases people enter the country surreptitiously without ever obtaining a visa often people entering in this fashion are economic refugees a class of refugee not recognized by the u s citizenship and immigration services formerly the immigration and naturalization service these persons have left their home country in a desperate bid to provide financial support for themselves and or their families this is particularly true in cases where minimum wage in the u s is several times what the average laborer earns in a given country such immigrants often send large portions of their income to their countries and families of origin much of the controversy today with immigration to the u s involves an increasing number of activists calling for a reduction in illegal immigration critics of these activists say that those who call for an end to illegal immigration really advocate an end to all immigration but do not realize it two claims made against immigration reduction activists by those opposed to restrictions on immigration are all the problems associated with illegal immigration race to the bottom in wages etc also apply almost equally to legal immigrants they allegedly misunderstand the immigration process and do not realize that many immigrant workers who they see as replacing american citizens in jobs they can do have immigrated completely legally albeit without citizenship this number exceeds the number of illegal immigrants on a per country basis on the other hand those who would reduce immigration make the point that illegal immigrants do not pay income taxes social security taxes or other taxes collected only from citizens with social security numbers yet those illegal immigrants do utilize the services and structures paid for by public money much of this argument is based on false information all employers are required by law to withhold income and payroll taxes illegals usually use a false social security number knowing that they will never receive benefits of course they all pay sales taxes property taxes directly or through landlords gasoline taxes hunting licenses and so on in terms of benefits the illegals are quite young so few receive social security or medicare and seldom receive any welfare payments the main cost to local government is the cost of public schools which by law must be open to all children most of the children of illegals are in fact american citizens because they were born in the us congress in early two zero zero six was debating provision to strip babies born in the us of their american citizenship if their parents were undocumented political issues surrounding immigration debates over immigration numbers in recent years a debate has arisen over the effect of high immigration levels into the united states on such issues as labor wages and ecology a movement has emerged which supports lower levels of legal and illegal immigration into the u s the most important of these groups is the federation for american immigration reform see immigration reduction there is also the issue of illegal immigrants coming to the us and giving birth thus having children who are american citizens immigration in popular culture the history of immigration to the united states of america is according to the claims of some the history of the united states itself and the journey from beyond the sea is an element found in the american myth appearing over and over again in everything from the godfather to gangs of new york to the song of myself to neil diamond s

norwegian film director and writer best known for his puppet films his most famous film is fl klypa grand prix pinchcliffe grand prix made in one nine seven five caprino was the son of furniture designer mario caprino and the artist ingeborg gude in the mid forties he helped his mother design puppets for a puppet theatre which inspired him to try making a film using his mother s designs the result of their collaboration was tim og t ffe an eight minute film released in one nine four eight several films followed in the next couple of years including two one five minute shorts that are still shown regularly in norway today veslefrikk og fela little freddy and his fiddle based on a norwegian folk tale and karius og baktus a story of two little trolls living in a boy s teeth ingeborg gude made the puppets for these films as well as she would continue to do up until her death in the mid sixties when making tim og t ffe caprino invented an ingenious method for controlling the puppet s movements in real time the technique can be described as a primitive mechanical version of animatronics caprino s films received rave reviews and he quickly became a celebrity in norway in particular the public were fascinated with the secret technology used to make his films when he switched to traditional stop motion caprino tried to maintain the impression that he was still using some kind of magic technology to make the puppets move even though all his later films were made with traditional stop motion techniques in addition to the short films caprino produced dozens of advertising films with puppets in one nine five nine he directed a live action feature film ugler i mosen which also contained stop motion sequences he then embarked on his most ambitious project a feature film about peter christen asbj rnsen who travelled around norway in the one nine th century collecting traditional folk tales the plan was to use live action for the sequences showing asbj rnsen and then to realise the folk tales using stop motion unfortunately caprino was unable to secure funding for the project so he ended up making the planned folk tale sequences as separate one six minute puppet films bookended by live action sequences showing asbj rnsen in one nine seven zero caprino and his small team of collaborators started work on a two five minutes tv special which would eventually become the pinchcliffe grand prix based on a series of books by norwegian cartoonist and author kjell aukrust it featured a group of eccentric characters all living in the small village of pinchcliffe the tv special was a collection of sketches based on aukrust s books with no real story line after one five years of work it was decided that it didn t really work as a whole so production on the tv special was stopped with the exception of some very short clips no material from it has ever been seen by the public and caprino and aukrust instead wrote a screenplay for a feature film using the characters and environments that had already been built the result was thhe pinchcliffe grand prix which stars theodore rimspoke and his two assistants sonny sonny duckworth a cheerful and optimistic bird and lambert a nervous pessimistic and melancholic hedgehog theodore works as a bicycle repairman though he spends most of his time inventing weird rube golberg like contraptions one day the trio discover that one of theodore s former assistants rudolph gore slimey has stolen his design for a race car engine and has become a world champion formula one driver sonny secures funding from an arab oil sheik who happens to be vacationing in pinchcliffe and the trio then build a gigantic racing car il tempo gigante a fabulous construction with two engines radar and its own blood bank theodore then enters a race and ends up winning beating gore slimey despite his attempts at sabotage the film was made in three five years by a team of approximately five people caprino directed and animated bjarne sandemose caprino s principal collaborator thoughout his career built the sets and the cars and was in charge of the technical side ingeborg riiser modeled the puppets and gerd alvsen made the costumes and props when it came out in one nine seven five the pinchcliffe grand prix was an enormous success in norway selling one million tickets in its first year of release it remains the biggest box office hit of all time in norway caprino studios claim it has sold five five million tickets to date though this number appears a bit exaggarated and was also released in many other countries to help promote the film abroad caprino and sandemose built a full scale replica of il tempo gigante it is a fully working car that can reach speeds of two eight zero km h except for some tv work in the late seventies caprino made no more puppet films focusing instead on creating attractions for a theme park outside lillehammer based on his folk tale movies and making tourist films using

sir walter scott it was written in one eight one nine and set in one two th century england an example of historical fiction ivanhoe is sometimes given credit for helping to increase popular interest in the middle ages in one nine th century europe it is the story of one of the remaining saxon noble families at a time when the nobility was overwhelmingly norman it follows the protagonist wilfred of ivanhoe a son of a saxon family out of favor with his father due to his unsuitable courting of a saxon princess named rowena and his allegiance to the norman king richard i of england as he comes back from the crusades the legendary robin hood under the title of locksley is also a character in the story and the character scott gave him in ivanhoe shaped the modern idea of robin hood the cheery noble outlaw ivanhoe himself spends much of the story out of action having been seriously wounded in the opening chapters he is nursed by rebecca daughter of isaac the jew but there can never be a romance between them partly because of her religion and partly because ivanhoe is already committed to the beautiful rowena his childhood love however his great enemy the templar sir brian de bois guilbert finds rebecca so irresistible that he is prepared to sacrifice everything for her many of the book s critics prefer rebecca as a heroine to the relatively colourless rowena in one eight five zero the novelist william makepeace thackeray wrote a spoof sequel to ivanhoe called rebecca and rowena the location of the novel is centred upon south yorkshire and north nottinghamshire in england indeed the castle within the story is based upon conisbrough castle near doncaster and still stands today as a popular tourist attraction reference is made within the story to the bishop of sheffield these references within the story contribute to the notion that robin hood lived or travelled in and around this area the ancient town of conisbrough is so dedicated to the story of ivanhoe that many of the streets schools and public buildings are named either after characters from the book or the one two th century castle characters ivanhoe rebecca rowena prince john the black knight locksley

wamba cedric s jester historical accuracy although the general political events depicted in the novel are relatively accurate it tells of the period of king richard s imprisonment in austria following the crusade and his return to england the story is heavily fictionalized most notably its depiction of an england in which saxon and norman nobles are at odds is highly anachronistic by the late one two th century there were no such distinctions among an upper class which generally had a common norman french culture with elements of english nobility mainly due to inter breeding between the different nationalities one inaccuracy in ivanhoe created a new name in the english language cedric the correct name is cerdic but sir walter committed a metathesis the satirist h h munro with his typical caustic wit commented it is not a name but a misspelling adaptations the novel has been the basis for two movies each also titled ivanhoe the one nine one three film production directed by

only one amine and one carboxyl group the pi can be calculated from the pka s of this molecule pi over two for amino acids with more than two ionizable groups such as lysine for example the same formula is used but this time the two pka s used are those of the two groups that lose and gain a charge from the neutral form of the amino acid proteins can be separated according to their isoelectric point in a process known as isoelectric focusing at a ph below the pi proteins carry a net positive charge above the pi they carry a net negative charge this has implications for running electrophoretic gels see agarose gel electrophoresis the ph of an electrophoretic gel is determined by the buffer used for that gel if the ph of the buffer is above the pi of the protein being run the protein will migrate to the positive pole negative charge is attracted to a positive pole if the ph of the buffer is below the pi of the protein being run the protein will migrate to the negative pole of the gel positive charge is attracted to the negative pole if the protein is run with a buffer ph that is equal to the pi it will not migrate at all this is also true for individual amino acids ions

union upu member countries the purpose of the irc is to be able to send someone in another country a letter along with the cost of postage for them to reply if the addressee is within the same country one simply sends them a self addressed stamped envelop sase but if you are sending a letter to another country it can be difficult to acquire stamps for that country to send along with your letter so you can purchase an irc instead from your local post office and send it to them they can then take it to a post office in their own country and use it to reply to your letter ircs have many common and practical uses a parent may include one in a letter to a student or military son or daughter in another country who may be strapped for cash to cover postage for a reply letter serious collectors often use ircs for example suppose an autograph collector has found a famous person in another country willing to grant an autograph including an irc with the request for the autograph would certainly improve the chances of receiving it or suppose a lace collector in the u s has found a kind person in france willing to donate an interesting piece of lace the collector would include an irc so as not to inconvenience the kind person by making them pay postage as the kind person is already granting the collector a great favor by giving him the lace the object of his or her collecting passion one interesting example of ircs the following this is often requested when a ham radio operator wishes to send a reception report in order to receive a qsl card the irc will cover postage ircs can also be used as international currency for small transactions since they have at least a small nominal value in all upu member countries as well as ircs administered by the upu there are also reply coupons

first pin is marked with the key black dot amd clone nec eight zero eight zero af two nd source the intel eight zero eight zero was an early microprocessor designed and manufactured by intel the eight bit cpu was released in april one nine seven four running at two mhz and is generally considered to be the first truly usable microprocessor cpu design description programming model the intel eight zero eight zero was the successor to the intel eight zero zero eight this was due to it being assembly language source compatible because it used the same instruction set developed by computer terminal corporation the eight zero eight zero s large four zero pin dip packaging permitted it to provide a one six bit address bus and an eight bit data bus allowing easy access to six four kilobytes of memory registers the processor had seven eight bit registers six of which could be combined into three one six bit register pairs bc de and hl it also had the eight bit accumulator the one six bit stack pointer to memory replacing the eight zero zero eight s internal stack and a one six bit program counter commands most of the eight bit operations were possible between the accumulator and either one of the registers or the memory cell indexed by the one six bit value of the register pair hl moving operations were supported between any two registers or between any register and the hl indexed memory cell the command system also had strange commands to move a byte from a given register into the same register mov a a for instance these commands were seldom used however unless programmed delays were needed the command to move from the hl indexed memory cell into the same memory cell i e mov m m always halted the processor until the external reset or interrupt signals were received thus instead of mov m m this command was marked as hlt halt and used for this purpose when required all processor commands were coded by one byte but some of them were followed by one or two bytes of data a memory address or a port number the register to register data move commands were all coded by one byte making up about a quarter of the commands in the processor command system the processor had eight commands to call the subroutines located at the fixed addresses at the beginning or the address space rst these commands were frequently used in the interrupt handling or system library calls the most sophisticated and the longest to execute command was xthl which was used for exchanging the register pair hl with the value stored at address indicated by the stack pointer one six bit operations despite the fact that the eight zero eight zero was generally an eight bit processor it was also able to increment or decrement any register pair inx dcx add the register pairs dad switch hl with de xchg and perform the one six bit arithmetical shift dad h with one command hence some one six bit operations were already possible input output scheme input output port space the eight zero eight zero supported up to two five six input output i o ports accessed from programs via dedicated i o instructions each instruction taking an i o port address as its operand this scheme using a separate i o address space is now less commonly used than memory mapping of i o ports devices at the time of the eight zero eight zero s launch this i o mapping scheme was seen as an advantage as it freed up the processor s limited number of address pins for the memory address space in most other cpu architectures however the mapping of i o ports in a common address space both for memory and i o gave a simpler instruction set no need for separate i o instructions the eight zero eight zero style i o port scheme continued into the intel eight zero eight five and x eight six families of microprocessors stack space one of the bits in the processor state word see below was indicating that the processor is accessing data from the stack using this signal it was possible to implement the separate stack memory space however this feature was seldom used shared memory implementations the eight zero eight zero has the shared control signals for reading and writing both to from memory and i o ports and in basic computers was frequently connected using the shared memory map accessing ports as the memory cells the specialised i o commands were either not used or in the applications with less memory were used knowning that the processor clones the eight bit port address to the higher address byte in zero x zero five would produce the zero x zero five zero five on the one six bit address bus the internal state word for the more complicated system during one phase of its working loop the processor was setting its internal state byte on the data bus this byte contained flags informing if the memory or i o port is accessed and also was necessary to handle the interrupts the interrupt system state enabled or disabled was also outputed into separate pin for the simple systems where the interrupts were not used it is possible to find curiosic cases using this pin as an additional single bit output port the russian popular radio eight six rk computer for instance pin usage the address bus had its own one six pins and the data bus had eight pins that were possible to use without any multiplexing using the two additional pins read and write signals it was possible to assemble simple microprocessor devices very easily only the separate io space interrupts and dma required additional chips to decode the processor pin signals however the processor load capacity was limited and even simple computers frequently contained the bus amplifiers the processor required three power sources five five and one two volt v and two non interlacing high amplitude synchronization signals however at least the late soviet version five eight zero eight zero was able to work with the single five v power source one two v pin being connected to the same five v and five v pin to the ground the processor consumed about one three watts w of power the pin usage table was described in the chip accompanying documentation as following pin number signal

eight zero eight zero was used in many early microcomputers such as the mits altair eight eight zero zero and imsai eight zero eight zero forming the basis for machines running the cp m operating system the later fully compatible and more capable zilog z eight zero processor would capitalize on this with z eight zero cp m becoming the dominant cpu os combination of the period much like x eight six ms dos for the pc a decade later the first single board microcomputer was based on the eight zero eight zero shortly after the launch of the eight zero eight zero the motorola six eight zero zero competing design was introduced and after that the mos technology six five zero two variation of the six eight zero zero zilog introduced the z eight zero which had a compatible machine language instruction set and initially used the same assembly language as the eight zero eight zero but for legal reasons zilog developed a syntactically different alternative assembly language for the z eight

identically this processor was the base of the radio eight six rk probably the most popular amateur single board computer in the soviet union in some other sources is written that the soviet analog has two undocumented its own specific commands but these were not widely known industry change the eight zero eight zero also changed how computers were created when the eight zero eight zero was introduced computer systems were usually created by computer manufacturers such as digital equipment corporation hewlett packard or ibm a manufacturer would produce the entire computer including processor terminals and system software such as compilers and operating system the eight zero eight zero was actually designed for just about any application except a complete computer system hewlett packard developed a terminal the hp two six four seven which was a terminal which ran basic on the eight zero eight zero microsoft would create the first popular programming language for the eight zero eight zero and would later acquire dos for the ibm pc as the eight zero eight zero evolved into the largely compatible x eight six family and pc s evolved into workstations and servers of three two and six four bits the basic architecture of the eight zero eight zero and its successors has replaced many propriety midrange and mainframe computers and withstood challenges of technologies such as risc most computer manufacturers have abandoned producing their own processors below the highest performance points though x eight six may not be the most elegant or theoretically most efficient design the sheer market force of so many dollars going into refining a design has made the x eight six family today and will remain for some time the dominant processor architecture even bypassing intel s attempts to replace it with incompatible architectures such as the iapx four three two and itanium microprocessors an intel eight zero eight six microprocessor the eight zero eight six is a one six bit microprocessor chip designed by intel in one nine seven eight which gave rise to the x eight six architecture shortly after the intel eight zero eight eight was introduced with an external eight bit bus allowing the use of cheap chipsets it was based on the design of the eight zero eight zero and eight zero eight five it was assembly language source compatible with the eight zero eight zero with a similar register set but was expanded to one six bits the bus interface unit fed the instruction stream to the execution unit through a six byte prefetch queue so fetch and execution were concurrent a primitive form of pipelining eight zero eight six instructions varied from one to four bytes buses address bus two zero bit address bus can access two two zero memory locations i e one mb of memory data bus one six bit data bus can access one six bit data in one operation hence called one six bit microprocessor control buses carries the essential signals for various operations it featured four one six bit general registers which could also be accessed as eight eight bit registers and four one six bit index registers including the stack pointer the data registers were often used implicitly by instructions complicating register allocation for temporary values it featured six four k eight bit i o or three two k one six bit ports and fixed vectored interrupts most instructions could only access one memory location so one operand had to be a register the result was stored in one of the operands there were also four segment registers that could be set from index registers the segment registers allowed the cpu to access one megabyte six four kb one six bytes of memory in an odd way rather than just supplying missing bytes as in most segmented processors the eight zero eight six shifted the segment register left four bits and added it to the address as a result segments overlapped which most people consider to have been poor design although this was largely acceptable and even useful for assembly language where control of the segments was complete it caused confusion in languages which make heavy use of pointers such as c it made efficient representation of pointers difficult and made it possible to have up to four zero nine six pointers with different values pointing to the same location worse this scheme made expanding the address space to more than one megabyte six four kb one six bytes difficult effectively it was expanded by changing the addressing scheme in the eight zero two eight six the processor runs at clock speeds

six bit registers and an eight bit external data bus the processor was used in the original ibm pc the eight zero eight eight was targeted at economical systems by allowing the use of eight bit designs large bus width circuit boards were still fairly expensive when it was released the prefetch queue of the eight zero eight eight is four bytes as opposed to the eight zero eight six s six

today the most influential microcomputer to use the eight zero eight eight was by far the ibm pc the original pc processor ran at a clock frequency of four seven seven mhz apparently ibm s own engineers wanted to use the motorola six eight zero zero zero and it was used later in the forgotten ibm instruments nine zero zero zero laboratory computer but ibm already had rights to manufacture the eight zero eight six family in exchange for giving intel the rights to its bubble memory designs a factor for using the eight bit intel eight zero eight eight version was that it could use existing intel eight zero eight five type components and allowed the computer to be based on a modified eight zero eight five design six eight zero zero zero components were not widely available at the time though it could use motorola six eight zero zero components to an extent intel bubble memory was on the market for a while but intel left the market due to fierce competition from japanese corporations who could undercut by cost and left the memory market to focus on processors a compatible replacement chip the v two zero was produced by nec for an approximate two zero percent improvement in computing power x eight six microprocessors this page refers to electrical insulation for thermal insulation see thermal insulation and for sound insulation see sound proofing conducting copper wire insulated by an outer layer of polyethylene an insulator is a material or object that resists the flow of electric charge the term electrical insulator has the same meaning as the term dielectric but the two terms are used in different contexts the opposite of electrical insulators are conductors and semiconductors which permit the flow of charge semiconductors are strictly speaking also insulators since they prevent the flow of electric charge at low temperatures unless doped with atoms that release extra charges to carry the current however some materials such as silicon dioxide are very nearly perfect electrical insulators which allows flash memory technology a much larger class of materials for example rubber and many plastics are good enough insulators to be used for home and office wiring being able to act as insulators into the range of hundreds of volts without noticeable loss of safety or efficiency high voltage insulators detail of the insulators the vertical string of discs on a two seven five zero zero zero volt suspension pylon near thornbury south gloucestershire england high voltage insulators used for high voltage power transmission are either porcelain insulators or composite insulators porcelain insulators are made from clay quartz or alumina and feldspar alumina insulators are used where high mechanical strength is a criterion in recent times there is a shift towards composite insulators which have a central rod made of fibre reinforced plastic and outer weathersheds made of silicone rubber or epdm glass insulators were and in some places are still used to mount electrical power lines most insulator manufacturers stopped making glass insulators in the late one nine six zero s switching to ceramic materials composite insulators are less costly light weight and have excellent hydrophobic capability and hence can be used in polluted areas the first glass insulators used en masse had an unthreaded pinhole these pieces of glass were positioned on a wooden pin vertically extending upwards from the pole s crossarm commonly only two insulators to a pole and maybe one on top of the pole itself natural contraction and expansion of the wires wrapped around the threadless insulator resulted in an unseating of the insulator from its pin hence a re seating was required by a designated person in one eight seven zero a patent was granted for putting threads into insulator pinholes to this day pin type insulators have threaded pinholes low voltage insulators insulating materials such as pvc polyvinyl chloride are used to minimise the possibility of a person coming into contact with a live wire some appliances such as electric shavers and hair dryers are doubly insulated to protect the user they can be recognised because their leads have two pins or on three pin plugs the third earth pin is made of plastic rather than metal in the eu double insulated appliances all are marked with a symbol of two squares one inside the other double insulation requires that cables have and supplementary insulation each of which is sufficient to prevent electric shock usually the internal electrical components are totally enclosed in an insulated packaging which prevents any contact with live parts collecting insulators in the late one nine six zero s and early one nine seven zero s insulators were being removed from telephone poles as advances in technology made these pieces of glass obsolete as linemen were taking down the old lines they started to notice the multitude of bright colors company names variety of shapes and important historical position held by insulators in the expansion of communication technology presently the insulator hobby is made up of thousands of people around the world

insulators internetworking involves connecting two or more distinct computer networks together into an internetwork often shortened to internet using devices called routers to connect them together to allow traffic to flow back and forth between them routers were originally called gateways but that term was discarded in this context due to confusion with functionally different devices using the same name the routers guide traffic on the correct path among several different ones usually available across the complete internetwork to their destination some people inaccurately refer to the connecting together of networks with bridges as internetworking but the resulting system mimics a single subnetwork and no internetworking protocol such as ip is required to traverse it internetworking started as a way to connect disparate types of networking technology but it became widespread through the developing need to connect two or more local area networks via some sort of wide area network the definition now includes the connection of other types of computer networks such as personal area networks the most notable example of internetworking in practice is the internet a network of networks running different low level protocols unified by an internetworking protocol the internet protocol ip ip only provides an unreliable packet service across an internet to transfer data reliably applications must utilize a transport layer protocol such as tcp which provides a reliable stream these terms do not mean that ip is actually unreliable but instead that it sends packets without contacting and establishing a connection with the destination router beforehand the opposite applies for reliable since tcp is the most widely used transport protocol people commonly refer to tcp and ip together as tcp ip some applications occasionally use a simpler transport protocol called udp for tasks which do not require absolutely reliable delivery of data such as video streaming see also history of the internet external links e book pdf format deals with the foundations of major internetworking architectures chapters four to nine infantry of the royal irish rifles during the battle of the somme in world war i infantry are soldiers or marines who fight primarily on foot with small arms in organized military units infantry also refers to the branch of the military in which these troops serve history with few exceptions most armies in history have been built around a core of infantry while the specific weapons have varied the common factor is that these soldiers have relied on their own two feet for transportation to the battlefield especially in the pre industrial era and tactical movement in earliest days infantry were little more than armed mobs fighting in opposing lines under the voice direction of individual commanders however the benefits of uniform equipment weaponry and above all training led to the development of formations able to carry out pre arranged maneuvers in the heat of battle as with any other area of conflict the history of infantry is a story of balance between heavily armed formations such as the greek phalanx fighting in rigid formations and more lightly armed but more mobile units like the roman legion able to move relatively quickly around the battlefield and exploit opportunities as they arose mobility weaponry and protection are the competing yet complementary factors which must be balanced to create effective infantry classical period examples of infantry units of the classical period are the phalanxes of ancient greece and the legions of imperial rome in contrast to the strictly organized phalanxes and legions most armies of the ancient world also employed units of skirmishers often mercenaries or slaves who wore minimal armor and carried an eclectic mix of weapons ranging from swords and javelins to slings and bows infantry was the primary combat arm of the period in open battles as a result of multiple factors including the cultural bias toward hand to hand combat and the relatively limited effectiveness of ranged weapons ranged weapons were primarily used as artillery and siege weapons large well disciplined units of infantry were common to the wars of the ancient world however as the roman empire declined and fell to the depredations of germanic tribes such as the vandals goths and visigoths in the five th century ad the political and military resources necessary for the maintenance of such units largely disappeared until the later middle ages with the appearance of the large bureaucratic systems associated with the monarchical nation states middle ages for most of the middle ages warfare and society were dominated by the glamour of cavalry expressed at the time in the form of knights knights were generally drawn from the aristocracy while the infantry levies were raised from the common folk or peasants this led to a stagnation of the technologies and tactics that would improve the effectiveness of the infantry however some tactics were seen to be very effective infantry often took up long spears or halberds to counter the long reach of knights lances it also became more and more common for infantry to carry ranged weapons as these would also effectively nullify the cavalry s advantage of momentum speed height and reach by the late middle ages these tactics were crystallizing relief of infantry at building of museum of art in olomouc the czech republic while bows remained in use long after the development of firearms technological fine tuning along with the development of the wheel lock allowed firearms to supersede even the feared english longbow as the ranged weapon of choice for infantry the bow also declined in favor due to the ease with which musketeers could be trained days or weeks to attain moderate proficiency as opposed to many years for the longbow many nations combined firearms with extremely long pikes into units that were virtually invincible against cavalry formations eventually with the development of the bayonet the pikemen were dropped from the formation resulting in the first examples of an infantry unit as recognizable today modern before the development of railroads in the one nine th century infantry armies got to the battlefield by walking or sometimes by ship the marines were first conceived in the one seven th century by the english royal navy due to britain s island status a large army was unnecessary however infantry soldiers were still required for eventual landings a typical royal navy warship carried six zero zero men of these men one two zero one eight zero would be royal marines these men usually had a deck to themselves and had little to do with sailing the vessel the men were proficient in the use of metal working gunpowder and modern weapons of the day and would form landing parties when exploring the marines also defended the vessel if boarded and would repair damaged weapons and cannon after a battle in the one eight nine zero s and later some countries used bicycle infantry but the real revolution in mobility started in the one nine two zero s with the use of motor vehicles resulting in motorized infantry action in world war ii demonstrated the importance of protecting the soldiers while they are moving around resulting in the development of mechanized infantry who use armored vehicles for transport world war ii also saw the first widespread use of paratroops which played key roles in several campaigns in the european theater during the vietnam conflict the united states army pioneered the use of helicopters to deliver large numbers of infantry quickly to and from key locations on the battlefield modern day mechanized infantry is supported by armored fighting vehicles artillery and aircraft but along with light infantry which does not use armored fighting vehicles is still the only kind of military force that can take and hold ground and thus remains essential to fighting wars organization historical military camp infantry infantry is notable by its reliance on organized formations to be employed in battle these have been developed over time but remain a key element to effective infantry development and deployment up until the two zero th century infantry units were for the most part employed in close organized formations up until the last moment possible this was necessary to allow commanders to retain control of the unit especially while maneuvering as well as allowing officers to retain discipline amongst the ranks with the development of weapons with increased firepower it became necessary to disperse the infantry over a wider expanse of terrain this made the unit less susceptible to high explosive and rapid fire weapons from world war i it was recognized that infantry were most successfully employed when using their ability to maneuver in constricted terrain and evade detection in ways not possible for other weapons such as vehicles this decentralization of command was made possible by improved communications equipment and greater focus on small unit training missions the most important role of the infantry has been as the primary force of an army it is the infantry which ultimately decides whether ground was held or taken and it is the presence of infantry that assures control of territory while the tactics of employment in battle have changed the basic missions of the infantry have not attack operations are the most basic role of the infantry and along with defense form the two primary stances of the infantry on the battlefield traditionally in an open battle or meeting engagement two armies would maneuver to contact at which point they would form up their infantry and other units opposite each other then one or both would advance and attempt to defeat the enemy force the goal of an attack remains the same to advance into an enemy held objective and dislodge the enemy thereby establishing control of the objective attacks are often feared by the infantry conducting them due to the high number of casualties suffered while advancing under enemy fire successful attacks rely on sufficient force preparative reconnaissance and bombardment and retention of unit cohesion throughout the attack defense operations are the natural counter to attacks in which the mission is to hold an objective and defeat enemy forces attempting to dislodge the defender defensive posture offers many advantages to the infantry including the ability to use terrain and constructed fortifications to advantage and the reduced exposure to enemy fire compared with advancing forces effective defense relies on minimizing losses to enemy fire breaking the enemy s cohesion before their advance is completed and preventing enemy penetration of defensive positions patrol is the most common infantry mission full scale attacks and defensive efforts are occasional but patrols are constant patrols consist of small groups of infantry moving about in areas of possible enemy activity to discern enemy deployments and ambush enemy patrols patrols are used not only on the front lines but in rear areas where enemy infiltration or insurgencies are possible pursuit is a role that the infantry often assumes the objective of pursuit operations is the destruction of enemy forces which are not capable of effectively engaging friendly units before they can build their strength to the point where they are effective infantry traditionally have been the main force to overrun these units in the past and in modern combat are used to pursue enemy forces in constricted terrain urban areas in particular where faster forces such as armored vehicles are incapable of going or would be exposed to ambush escort consists of protecting other units from ambush particularly from other infantry this is one of the most important roles for the modern infantry in particular when operating along side armored vehicles in this capacity infantry essentially conducts patrol on the move scouring terrain which may hide enemy infantry waiting to ambush friendly vehicles and identifying enemy strong points for attack by the heavier units maneuver operations consume much of an infantry unit s time infantry like all combat units are often maneuvered to meet battlefield needs and often must do so under enemy attack the infantry must maintain their cohesion and readiness during the move to ensure their usefulness when they reach their objective traditionally infantry have relied on their own legs for mobility but modern infantry often uses trucks and armored vehicles for transport reserve assignments for infantry units involve deployment behind the front although patrol and security operations are usually maintained in case of enemy infiltration this is usually the best time for infantry units to integrate replacements into units and to maintain equipment additionally soldiers can be rested and general readiness should improve however the unit must be ready for employment at any point construction can be undertaken either in reserve or on the front but consists of using infantry troops as labor for construction of field positions roads bridges airfields and all other manner of structures the infantry is often given this assignment due the quantity of men within the unit although it can lessen a unit s morale and limit the unit s ability to maintain readiness and perform other missions equipment the equipment of infantry forces has evolved along with the development of military technology in general but certain constants remain regarding the design and selection of this equipment primary types of equipment are weaponry protective gear survival gear and special equipment infantry weapons include all types of personal weapons i e anything that can be handled by individual troops as well as some small crew served weapons that can be carried and used by infantry modern infantry weaponry include rifles machine guns shoulder fired rocket launchers and missiles and lighter mortars and grenade launchers older examples of infantry weapons include all sorts of melee weapons and some light ranged weapons such as spears bows and slings during operations especially in modern times infantry have a tendency to scavenge and employ whatever weapons they can acquire in addition to those given them by their superiors infantry protective gear includes all equipment designed to protect the soldier against enemy attack most protective gear comprises body armor of some type classical and medieval infantry employed leather and metal armor as defense against both ranged and melee attacks but with the advent of firearms such armor could no longer defeat attacks and was discarded the return to use of the helmet was prompted by the need to defend against high explosive fragmentation and further developments in materials led to effective bullet defeating armor within the weight acceptable for infantry use the use of body armor is again becoming widespread amongst infantry units primarily using kevlar technology infantry must also often carry protective measures against chemical and biological attack including gas masks counter agents and protective suits infantry survival gear includes all of the items soldiers require for day to day survival in the combat environment these include basic environmental protections medical supplies food and sundries traditionally infantry have suffered large casualty rates from disease exposure and privation often in excess of those suffered from enemy attacks better equipment of troops in this area greatly reduce this rate of loss one of the most valuable pieces of gear is the entrenching tool basically a small shovel which can be employed not only to dig important defenses but also in a variety of other daily tasks and even as an effective weapon specialized equipment consists of a variety of gear which may or may not be carried depending on the mission and the level of equipment of an army communications gear has become a necessity as it allows effective command of infantry units over greater distances in some units individual communications are being used to allow the greatest level of flexibility engineering equipment including demolitions mines and other gear is also commonly carried by the infantry or attached specialists a variety of other gear often relating to a specific mission or to the particular terrain in which the unit is employed can be carried by infantry units there are some general rules to which all infantry equipment must adhere to be effective and widely adopted reliability equipment failure is fatal to the infantry and if equipped with unreliable gear morale will suffer greatly soldiers tend to prefer reliable proven technology to new unproven gadgets additionally the conditions in which infantry operate are often extreme and gear must be able to survive and operate in these condition without fail utility infantry have very limited weight capacity and thus gear which doesn t help them do their job will be discarded availability since infantry units are often large and must be able to be raised in quantity a particular tool must be available in sufficient quantity to equip the units this means that it must be inexpensive enough to afford in quantity during peacetime and producible enough to meet wartime demands simplicity infantry relies on large numbers of troops often conscripted and therefore of lesser quality than those available to other branches an army must be able to train its troops uniformly in minimal time on the tools of the trade overly complex gear will often be useless in combat due to a lack of training or the difficulty of maintenance under field conditions quotations i love the infantry because they are the underdogs they are the mud rain frost and wind boys they have no comforts and they even learn to

occupations in mathematics an identity function also called identity map or identity transformation is a function which does not have any effect it always returns the same value that was used as its argument in other words the identity function is the function f x x definition formally if m is a set the identity function f on m is defined to be that function with domain and codomain m which satisfies f x x for all elements x in m the identity function f on m is often denoted by id m or one m algebraic property if f m n is any function then we have f o id m f id n o f where o denotes function composition in particular id m is the identity element of the monoid of all functions from m to m since the identity element of a monoid is unique one can alternately define the identity function on m to be this identity element such a definition generalizes to the concept of an identity morphism in category theory where the endomorphisms of m need not be functions examples the identity function on the positive integers is a completely multiplicative function essentially multiplication by one considered in number theory in an n dimensional vector space the identity function is represented by the identity matrix i n regardless of the basis in a metric space the identity is trivially an isometry an object without any symmetry has as symmetry group the trivial group only containing this isometry symmetry type c one see also inclusion map elementary mathematics an intel eight zero three eight six microprocessor the intel eight zero three eight six is a microprocessor which was used as the central processing unit cpu of many personal computers from one nine eight six until one nine nine four and later during its design phase the processor was code named simply p three the third generation processor in the x eight six line but was and is frequently referred to as the i three eight six designed and manufactured by intel the i three eight six processor was taped out in october of one nine eight five intel decided against producing the chip before then as the cost of production would have been uneconomic full function chips were first delivered to customers in one nine eight six motherboards for three eight six based computer systems were highly elaborate and expensive to produce but were rationalised upon the three eight six s mainstream adoption the processor was a significant evolution in a long line of processors that stretched back to the intel eight zero zero eight the predecessor of the eight zero three eight six was the intel eight zero two eight six a one six bit processor with a segment based memory management and protection system the eight zero three eight six added a three two bit architecture and a paging translation unit which made it much easier to implement operating systems which used virtual memory the eight zero three eight six featured three operating modes real mode protected mode and virtual mode in the real mode the eight zero three eight six like the eight zero two eight six would run just as a fast eight zero one eight six the protected mode allowed the use of all the possibilities of the two eight six and the protected mode extension of the three eight six especially addressing up to four gb of memory finally the virtual eight zero eight six or v eight six mode made it possible to run one or more virtual eight zero eight six machines in a protected environment the three eight six dx architecture though intel would shortly introduce the eight zero four eight six and eventually the intel pentium line of processors the support in the three eight six for the three two bit flat memory model would be arguably the most important feature change until the release of em six four t in two zero zero four other microprocessor architectures such as the motorola six eight zero zero zero had long since supported a flat three two bit addressing model most applications running on current intel based personal computers will still run on the older eight zero three eight six albeit very slowly there were relatively few instructions added to the main instruction set in later generations and in most cases their usage can be avoided building a program for the eight zero two eight six was often much harder early eight zero three eight six s had a bug in the three two bit multiply instruction which would leave the high word in the result undefined once discovered such processors were stamped one six bit sw only this bug was checked for by programs such as microsoft windows which would issue a warning message late in the eight zero three eight six s production run intel introduced the eight zero three eight six sx which was meant to be a low cost version of the three eight six line the sx series of chips was three two bit internally but had a one six bit external bus in much the same way that the eight zero eight eight in the original ibm pc was a lower cost version of the eight zero eight six and so no three two bit physical address space extension the original eight zero three eight six was subsequently renamed the eight zero three eight six dx to avoid confusion neither cpu included a math coprocessor most motherboards included a socket for an eight zero three eight seven though the naming would cause some head scratching later when the eight zero four eight six came in a dx variant that did include floating point capability which was physically present but disabled in early four eight six sxs the three eight six sl was introduced as an alternative processor for laptop computers the processor offered several power management options e g smm as well as different sleep modes to conserve battery power it also contained support for an external cache of one six to six four kb the extra functions caused this variant to have over three times as many transistors as the three eight six dx the three eight six sl was only available in one clock speed two five mhz an embedded version of the chip the three eight six ex was produced later and was successfully used in space applications the amd am three eight six dx four zero because of the high degree of compatibility the range of processors compatible with the eight zero three eight six is often collectively termed the i three eight six architecture the instruction set for the architecture is now known as ia three two or informally i three eight six from a business perspective the i three eight six was significant because it was the first significant microprocessor to be single sourced it was available only from intel corp prior to this the difficulty of making chips and the uncertainty of reliable supply required that any mass market semiconductor be multi sourced that is made by two or more manufacturers the second and subsequent ones manufacturing under license from the designer single sourcing the i three eight six allowed intel greater control over its development and substantially greater profits in later years however amd introduced its compatible am three eight six processor in march one nine nine one after overcoming legal obstacles thus breaking intel s

being executed in simple processors each instruction to be executed is loaded into the instruction register which holds it while it is decoded prepared and ultimately executed which can take several steps more complicated processors use a pipeline of instruction registers where each stage of the pipeline does part of the decoding preparation or execution and then passes it to the next stage for its step modern processors can even do some of the steps of out of order as decoding on several instructions is done in parallel decoding the opcode in the instruction register includes determining the instruction determining where its operands are in memory retrieving the operands from memory allocating processor resources to execute the command in superscalar processors etc digital electronics

other languages have cryptic and redundant syntax in intercal from the intercal reference manual it is a well known and oft demonstrated fact that a person whose work is incomprehensible is held in high esteem for example if one were to state that the simplest way to store a value of six five five three six in a three two bit intercal variable is do one any sensible programmer would say that that was absurd since this is indeed the simplest method the programmer would be made to look foolish in front of his boss who would of course have happened to turn up as bosses are wont to do the effect would be no less devastating for the programmer having been correct the intercal manual also contains many paradoxical nonsensical or otherwise humorous instructions caution under no circumstances confuse the mesh with the interleave operator except under confusing circumstances intercal has many other features designed to make it even more aesthetically unpleasing to the programmer it uses statements such as read out ignore forget and please the intercal manual gives unusual names for all non alphanumeric ascii characters single and double quotes are sparks and rabbit

for rowing indoor rowing has become established as a sport in its own right the term also refers to a participant in this sport an indoor rower is also known as an ergometer slang ergo or erg an ergometer being a device which measures the amount of energy or work performed the indoor rower is calibrated to measure the amount of energy the rower is generating ergometer comes from the greek word s ergon meaning work and metron meaning measure an ergometer therefore is a device that literally means work measurer layout of the machine although several simple machines exist for casual home use there are three major models rowperfect waterrower and concept two of these the concept two is the most popular and is generally considered the standard training option for world class rowers each machine consists of a flywheel connected to a chain and handle the rower pushes his body backwards with the legs and pulls on the handle causing the flywheel to spin the flywheel has a damping mechanism applied using either air or water that is intended to simulate the feel of an oar moving through water depending on the machine the rower either moves back and forth as part of the rowing action or the rower remains stationary and the flywheel mechanism moves the machines where the rower remains stationary are generally considered to better simulate the feel of a boat the rowbike is an outdoor rowing machine that is a hybrid of the concept two and a recumbent bicycle concept two machines features a digital performance monitor that can display the athlete s work output in watts calories or notional meters that are roughly calibrated to correspond to the speed of a four man boat on the water the standard measurement of speed on an ergometer is generally known as the split or the amount of time in minutes and seconds required to travel five zero zero meters at the current pace for example a two zero zero split would correspond to a two zero zero time for a five zero zero meter race or an eight zero zero time for a two kilometer race the split does not necessarily correspond to how many strokes the rower takes the rating since strokes can vary in power competitions concept two organizes a large number of indoor rowing competitions all over the world including the world championships a k a crash b sprints held in boston massachusetts usa in february and the british indoor rowing championships held in birmingham england in november the usual distance for competition is two zero zero zero m the machines used are very consistent and although the resistance may be adjusted a result on one machine can be fairly compared with results on other machines regardless of resistance level the prevalence of concept two machines creates a standard which facilitates competition indoor rowing is an inclusive sport perhaps because indoor rowing has historically been used for fitness training and self improvement rather than as an independent form of competition despite increasing competitiveness in recent years most major competitions include many categories based on age as well as weight while the fastest times are generally achieved by rowers between two zero and four zero years old teenagers and rowers over nine zero are common at competitions inexperienced rowers as well as world class athletes are welcome the world records for two zero zero zero m

derived ipx from xerox network services idp protocol ipx usage is in general decline as the boom of the internet has made tcp ip nearly universal computers and networks can run multiple network

with ip the ipx network address is conceptually identical to the network part of the ip address the parts with netmask bits set to one the node address then has the same meaning as the bits of ip address with netmask bits set to zero as the node address is usually identical to the mac address of the network adapter the address resolution protocol is not needed for routing the entries in the

classified into two categories declarations adopted by bodies such as the united nations general assembly which are not legally binding although they may be politically so and conventions which are legally binding instruments concluded under international law international human rights instruments can be divided further into global instruments to which any state in the world can be a party and regional instruments which are restricted to states in a particular region of the world most conventions establish mechanisms to oversee their implementation in some cases these mechanisms have relatively little power and are often ignored by member states in other cases these mechanisms have great political and legal authority and their decisions are almost always implemented examples of the first case include the un treaty committees while the best exemplar of the second case is the european court of human rights mechanisms also vary as to the degree of individual access to them under some conventions e g the european convention on human rights as it currently exists individuals are permitted automatically to take individual cases to the enforcement mechanisms under most however e g the un conventions individual access is contingent on the acceptance of that right by each state party either by a declaration at the time of ratification or accession or through

zero zero two human rights instrumentsinternational law indian removal was a nineteenth century policy of the government of the united states that sought to relocate american indian or native american tribes living east of the mississippi river to lands west of the river in the decades following the american revolution the desire for more land by the rapidly increasing population of the united states resulted in numerous treaties in which lands were purchased from native americans eventually the u s government began encouraging indian tribes to sell their land by offering them land in the west outside the boundaries of the then existing u s states where the tribes could resettle this process was accelerated with the passage of the indian removal act of one eight three zero which provided funds for president andrew jackson to conduct land exchange removal treaties an estimated one zero zero zero zero zero american indians eventually relocated in the west as a result of this policy most of them emigrating during the one eight three zero s settling in what was known as the indian territory contrary to some modern misconceptions and misrepresentations the removal act did not order the forced removal of any native americans nor did president jackson ever publicly advocate forced removal in theory indian removal was supposed to be voluntary and many american indians did indeed remain in the east in practice however the jackson administration put great pressure on tribal leaders to sign removal treaties this pressure created bitter divisions within american indian nations as different tribal leaders advocated different responses to the question of removal sometimes u s government officials ignored tribal leaders who resisted signing removal treaties and dealt with those who favored removal the treaty of new echota for example was signed by a faction of prominent cherokees leaders but not by the elected tribal leadership the terms of the treaty were aggressively enforced by president martin van buren which resulted in the unintentional deaths of an estimated four zero zero zero cherokees mostly from disease on the trail of tears the choctaw tribe also suffered greatly from disease during removal the suffering which resulted from indian removal was aggravated by poor administration inadequate measures taken to provide for the emigrants and failure to protect indian legal rights before and after emigration most american indians reluctantly but peacefully complied with the terms of the removal treaties often with bitter resignation some groups however went to war to resist the implementation of removal treaties this resulted in two short wars the black hawk war of one eight three two and the second creek war of one eight three six as well as the long and costly second seminole war one eight three five one eight four two background since the presidency of thomas jefferson america s policy had been to allow indians to remain east of the mississippi as long as they became assimilated or civilized they were to settle in one place farm the land divide communal land into private property and adopt democracy indian removal in the south in one eight three zero the so called five civilized tribes the chickasaw choctaw creek seminole and cherokee were still living east of the mississippi they were called civilized because many tribesmen had adopted various aspects of european american culture including christianity the cherokees had a system of writing their own language developed by sequoyah and published a newspaper in cherokee and english in spite of this acculturation the position of the tribes was not secure some felt the presence of the tribes was a threat to peace and security since many native americans had fought against the united states in previous wars often armed by foreign nations such as great britain and spain other white settlers and land speculators simply desired the land that was occupied by the tribes accordingly governments of the various u s states desired that all tribal lands within their boundaries be placed under state jurisdiction in one eight three zero georgia passed a law which prohibited whites from living on indian territory after march three one one eight three one without a license from the state this law was written to justify removing white missionaries who were helping the indians resist removal missionary organizer jeremiah evarts urged the cherokee nation to take their case to the u s supreme court the marshall court ruled that while indian tribes were not sovereign nations cherokee nation v georgia one eight three one state laws had no force on tribal lands worcester v georgia one eight three two president andrew jackson is often quoted as having responded to the court by defiantly proclaiming john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it jackson probably did not say this although he was criticized then and since for making no effort to protect the tribes from state governments andrew jackson and other candidates of the new democratic party had made indian removal a major goal in the campaign of one eight two eight in one eight three zero congress passed the indian removal act and president jackson signed it into law the removal act provided for the government to negotiate removal treaties with the various tribes the treaty of dancing rabbit creek with the choctaw was the first such removal treaty implemented while around seven zero zero zero choctaws ultimately stayed in mississippi about one four zero zero zero moved along the red river other treaties like the dubious treaty of new echota with the cherokee followed resulting in the trail of tears as a result the five tribes were resettled in the new indian territory in modern day oklahoma and parts of kansas some indians eluded removal while those who lived on individually owned land rather than tribal domains were not subject to removal those who stayed behind eventually formed tribal groups including the eastern band cherokee based in north carolina in one eight three five the seminoles refused to leave florida leading to the second seminole war the most important leader in the war was osceola who led the seminoles in their fight against removal hiding in the everglades of florida osceola and his band used surprise attacks to defeat the u s army in many battles in one eight three seven osceola was tricked into capture when he came to negotiate peace during a truce he died in prison the seminoles continued to fight some traveled deeper into the everglades while others moved west the second seminole war ended in one eight four two when the united states won in one eight three five almost one five zero zero zero creeks were forcibly

icons and other symbols or monuments usually for religious or political motives in christian circles iconoclasm has generally been motivated by a literal interpretation of the second of the ten commandments which forbids the making and worshipping of graven images it has sometimes been motivated by christological or even political concerns as well people who engage in such practices are called iconoclasts a term that has come to be applied to any person who breaks or disdains established dogmas or conventions conversely people who revere or venerate religious images are called iconodules iconoclasms can be carried out by people of a different religion but are often the result of sectarian disputes between factions of the same religion iconoclasm was a cultural product of the russian revolution of one nine one seven and numerous mainly peasant revolts throughout history byzantine iconoclasm a thorough understanding of the iconoclastic period in byzantium is complicated by the circumstance that much of what exists as accounts and arguments of the time comes to us through the filter of the writings of the ultimate victor in the controversy pope julius ii warrior pope keeper of light it is thus difficult to obtain a complete objective balanced and reliably accurate account of events and various aspects of the controversy the first iconoclastic period seven three zero seven eight seven sometime between seven two six seven three zero the byzantine emperor leo iii the syrian or isaurian reigned seven one seven seven four one born in eastern turkey ordered the removal of an image of jesus prominently placed over the palace gate of constantinople at least some of those assigned to the task were murdered by a band of iconodules see theophanes chronographia writings suggest that at least part of the reason for the removal may have been military reversals against the muslims and the eruption of the volcanic island of thera which leo possibly viewed as evidence of the wrath of god brought on by image veneration in the church according to accounts by patriarch nikephoros and the chronicler theophanes leo is said to have described image veneration as a craft of idolatry he apparently forbade the worship of religious images in a seven three zero edict which did not apply to other forms of art including the image of the emperor or even religious

iconoclast council in which some three three zero to three four zero bishops participated this council became known as a robber council due to its uncanonical nature edward j martin writes a history of the iconoclastic controversy p four six on the ecumenical character of the council there are graver doubts its president was theodosius archbishop of ephesus son of the emperor apsimar he was supported by sisinnius bishop of perga also known as pastillas and by basil of antioch in pisidia styled tricaccabus not a single patriarch was present the see of constantinople was vacant whether the pope and the patriarchs of alexandria antioch and jerusalem were invited or not is unknown they were not present either in person or by deputy the council of nicaea ii considered this was a serious flaw in the legitimacy of the council it had not the co operation of the roman pope of the period nor of his clergy either by representative or by encyclical letter as the law of councils requires citing j d mansi xiii two zero seven d the life of stephen borrows this objection from the acts and embroiders it to suit the spirit of the age of theodore it had not the approval of the pope of rome although there is a canon that no ecclesiastical measures may be passed without the pope citing vit steph one one four four c the absence of the other patriarchs is then noticed mansi above the iconoclast council of hieria was not the end of the matter however in this period complex theological arguments appeared both for and against the use of icons the monasteries were strongholds of icon veneration and an underground network of iconodules was organized among monks one syrian monk john of damascus was the major opponent of iconoclasm through his theological writings another theodore the studite wrote a letter against the emperor to pope paschal an act with strong political implications in a response recalling the later protestant reformation constantine moved against the monasteries had relics thrown into the sea and stopped the invocation of saints constantine s son leo iv seven seven five eight zero was less rigorous trying to conciliate factions until near the end of his life when he took severe measures against images and would have banned his secretly icon venerating athenian wife irene but before that happened he died and irene took power as regent for her son constantine vi seven eight zero nine seven with irene s ascension as regent the first iconoclastic period came to an end irene initiated a new ecumenical council ultimately called the second council of nicaea which first met in constantinople in seven eight six but was disrupted by military units faithful to the iconoclast legacy it convened again at nicea in seven eight seven and reversed the decrees of the previous iconoclast council held at constantinope and hieria and appropriated its title as seventh ecumenical council so there were two councils called the seventh ecumenical council the first supporting iconoclasm the second supporting icon veneration and negating the first the decrees of this council unlike those of the iconoclast council were approved by the papacy eastern orthodoxy today considers it the last genuine ecumenical council icon veneration lasted through the reign of empress irene s successor nicephorus i reigned eight zero two eight one one and the two brief reigns after his the second iconoclastic period eight one four eight four two emperor leo v reigned eight one three eight two zero instituted a second period of iconoclasm in eight one three again possibly moved in part by military failures seen as indicative of divine displeasure leo was succeeded by michael ii who in an eight two four letter to louis the pious lamented the appearance of image veneration in the church and such practices as making icons baptismal godfathers to infants he confirmed the decrees of the iconoclast council of seven five four michael was succeeded by his son theophilus theophilus died leaving his wife theodora regent for his minor heir michael iii like irene five zero years before her theodora mobilized the iconodules and proclaimed the restoration of icons in eight four three since that time the first sunday of lent is celebrated in the churches of the orthodox tradition as the feast of the triumph of orthodoxy issues in

picture of a soldier offering christ vinegar on a sponge attached to a pole below is a picture of an iconoclast deleting the image of christ with a similar sponge attached to a pole what accounts of iconoclast arguments remain are largely found in iconodule writings to understand iconoclastic arguments one must note the main points iconoclasm condemned the making of any lifeless image e g painting or statue that was intended to represent jesus or one of the saints the epitome of the definition of the iconoclastic conciliabulum held in seven five four declared supported by the holy scriptures and the fathers we declare unanimously in the name of the holy trinity that there shall be rejected and removed and cursed one of the christian church every likeness which is made out of any material and colour whatever by the evil art of painters if anyone ventures to represent the divine image karakthr of the word after the incarnation with material colours let him be anathema if anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself let him be anathema for iconoclasts the only real religious image must be an exact likeness of the prototype of the same substance which they considered impossible seeing wood and paint as empty of spirit and life thus for iconoclasts the only true and permitted icon of jesus was the eucharist which was believed to be his actual body and blood any true image of jesus must be able to represent both his divine nature which is impossible because it cannot be seen nor encompassed and his human nature which is possible but by making an icon of jesus one is separating his human and divine natures since only the human can be depicted separating the natures was considered nestorianism or else confusing the human and divine natures considering them one union of the human and divine natures was considered monophysitism icon use for religious purposes was viewed as an innovation in the church a satanic misleading of christians to return to pagan practice satan misled men so that they worshipped the creature instead of the creator the law of moses and the prophets cooperated to remove this ruin but the previously mentioned demiurge of evil gradually brought back idolatry under the appearance of christianity epitome iconoclast council at hieria seven five four it was also seen as a departure from ancient church tradition of which there was a written record opposing religious images the chief theological opponents of iconoclasm were the monks mansur john of damascus who living in muslim territory as advisor to the caliph of damascus was far enough away from the byzantine emperor to evade retribution and theodore the studite who lived within the empire john declared that he did not venerate matter but rather the creator of matter however he also declared but i also venerate the matter through which salvation came to me as if filled with divine energy and grace he includes in this latter category the ink in which the gospels were written as well as the paint of images the wood of the cross and the body and blood of jesus the iconodule response to iconoclasm included assertion that the biblical commandment forbidding images of god had been superseded by the incarnation of jesus who being the second person of the trinity is god incarnate in visible matter therefore they were not depicting the invisible god but god as he appeared in the flesh this became an attempt to shift the issue of the incarnation in their favor whereas the iconoclasts had used the issue of the incarnation against them further in their view idols depicted persons without substance or reality while icons depicted real persons essentially the argument was all religious images not of our faith are idols all images of our faith are icons to be venerated this was considered comparable to the old testament practice of only offering burnt sacrifices to god and not to any other gods regarding the written tradition opposing the making and veneration of images they asserted that icons were part of unrecorded oral tradition par dosis sanctioned in orthodoxy as authoritative in doctrine by reference to two thessalonians two one five basil the great etc iconodules further argued that decisions such as whether icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council not imposed on the church by an emperor thus the issue also involved the issue of the proper relationship between church and state related to this was the observation that it was foolish to deny to god the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor emperors had always intervened in ecclesiastical matters since the time of constantine i as cyril mango writes the legacy of nicaea the first universal council of the church was to bind the emperor to something that was not his concern namely the definition and imposition of orthodoxy if need be by force oxford history of byzantium two zero zero two that practice continued from beginning to end of the iconoclastic controversy and beyond with some emperors enforcing iconoclasm and two empresses regent enforcing the re establishment of icon veneration one distinction between the iconoclastic emperors and constantine i is that the latter did not dictate the conclusion of the first council of nicaea before summoning it whereas leo iii began enforcing a policy of iconoclasm more than twenty years before the council of hieria would endorse it islamic and buddhist iconoclasm because of the prohibition against figural decoration in mosques not as is often said a total ban on the use of images some muslim groups have on occasion committed acts of iconoclasm against the devotional images of other religions a recent example of this is the two zero zero one destruction of frescoes and the monumental statues of the buddha at bamiyan by a radical sect and nationalist group the taliban historically despite a religious prohibition on destroying or converting houses of worship conquering muslim armies would use local temples or houses of worship as mosques an example is the hagia sophia church of the holy wisdom in istanbul formerly constantinople which was converted into a mosque in one four five three when its mosaics were covered with plaster instead of being destroyed the dome of the rock in jerusalem was built on top of the remains of the jewish temple in jerusalem similar acts of iconoclasm occurred in parts of north africa in india a number of former buddhist monasteries and hindu temples were conquered and rebuilt as mosques in recent years right wing hindu nationalists have torn down some of these mosques such as the famous babri masjid and attempted to replace them with hindu temples reformation

fertility ritual was subsequently adopted as st brigid s day in the christian period and in more recent times has been celebrated as a fire festival one of eight holidays festivals four solar and four fire lunar or sabbats of the neopagan wheel of the year imbolc is arguably one of the predecessors of the christian holiday of candlemas imbolc is conventionally celebrated on one february although the celtic festival commenced on january three one in more recent times the occasion has been generally celebrated by modern pagans on feb one or two some neopagans relate this celebration to the midpoint between the winter solstice and spring equinox which actually falls on feb four or five celtic origins evidence of how imbolc was celebrated in ireland derives from folklore collected during the one nine th and early two zero th century in rural ireland and scotland compared with studies of similar customs in scandinavia like other festivals of the celtic calendar in irish mythology imbolc was celebrated on the eve of one february which marked the beginning of the day according to celtic custom the festival was traditionally associated with the onset of lactation of ewes soon to give birth to the spring lambs this could vary by as much as two weeks before or after the start of february the name in the irish language means in the belly i mbolg referring to the pregnancy of ewes and is also a celtic term for spring another name is oimelc meaning ewe s milk also brigid referring to the celtic goddess of smithcraft to whom the day is sacred that imbolc was an important time to the ancient inhabitants of ireland can be seen at the mound of the hostages in tara ireland here the inner chamber is perfecty aligned with the rising sun of both imbolc and samhain the holiday is a festival of light reflecting the lengthening of the day and the hope of spring it is traditional to light all the lamps of the house for a few minutes on imbolc and rituals often involve a great deal of candles st brigid s day in the modern irish calendar imbolc is variously known as the feast of st brigid secondary patron of ireland and l feabhra the first day of spring one view is that christianity in an attempt to reconcile the popularity of this festival with its own traditions took over the feast of imbolc and effectively redesignated it as st brigid s day one folk tradition that continues in both christian and pagan home on st brigid s day or imbolc is that of the brigid s bed the young girls of the household or village create a corn dolly adorning it with ribbons and baubles the older women then make a bed for bridig to lay in on st brigid s eve jan three one the young women gather together in one house to stay up all night with the corn dolly and are later visited by all the young men of the community who must treat them and the corn dolly with respect meanwhile the older women of the community stay at home and perform other ceremonies before going to bed each household completely douses its hearth and rakes the ashes smooth in the morning they look for some kind of mark on the ashes a sign that brigid has passed that way in the night or morning on the following day the bride s bed is brought from house to house where she is welcomed with great honor since brigid represents the life force that will bring people from the backside of winter into spring her presence is very important at this time of year people often will tap her effigy with an ash wand as well perhaps an old remnant of more potent fertility rites that were once practiced modern neopaganism today most modern neopagans celebrate it on the one st or two nd the two nd being more popular in america perhaps because of the holiday s later identification with candlemas in the southern hemisphere it is celebrated in august some modern pagans argue that the christian feast of candlemas whose date depends upon christmas was a christianization of the feast of imbolc on the other hand there is no evidence that imbolc was celebrated in pre christian times anywhere other than in ireland whereas the celebration of candlemas began in the eastern mediterranean imbolc is often defined as a cross quarter day midway between the winter solstice yule and the spring equinox ostara and the precise midpoint is half way through aquarius in the northern hemisphere or leo in the southern hemisphere by this definition imbolc in the northern hemisphere coincides with lughnasadh in the southern hemisphere fire is important for this festival as brigid also known as bride brigit brid is the goddess of fire healing and fertility the lighting of fires represents the increasing power of the sun over the coming months references to the festival of the growing light can even be traced to modern america in the groundhog day custom on february two if the groundhog sees his shadow on this morning and is frightened back into his burrow it means there will be six more weeks of winter the custom comes directly from europe and scotland in particular where an old couplet goes if candlemas day is bright and clear there ll be two winters in the year during the winter the maiden

that monarch who died six nine eight bc and may have been contemporary for some years with manasseh thus isaiah may have prophesied for the long period of at least sixty four years the prophet isaiah

seems to warn erring judah of impending divine judgement through foreign conquest while the second seems to provide comfort to a broken people other scholars such as margalioth one nine six four challenged the view of multiple authorship by pointing out the remarkable unity of the book isaiah in terms of theme message and vocabulary even certain verbal formulas unique to isaiah such as the mouth of the lord has spoken appears in both halves of isaiah but in no other hebrew prophetic literature while clear differences between the two halves of the book were evident thematically the two halves are remarkably similar certainly more similar to each other than to any other existing prophetic literature recent trends in critical scholarship have focused on synchronic approaches which advocate a whole text reading rather than the traditional historical critical diachronic approaches which tend to be directed at taking the text apart looking for sources redactional seams etc inspired by hebrew bible literary criticism done by robert alter recent scholars have tended to circumscribe authorship and historical critical questions and look at the final form of the book as a

interpreted therefore this designation refers to languages implementations rather than designs in fact many languages have both compilers and interpreters including lisp c basic and python this term has no meaning in computer science which strictly distinguishes between languages and implementations however people often use it as a useful shortcut to signify languages that are traditionally interpreted or for which no compilers are written historical background in the early days of computing language design was heavily influenced by the decision to use compilation or interpretation as a mode of execution for example some compiled languages require that programs must explicitly state the data type of a variable at the time it is declared or first used on the other hand some languages take advantage of the dynamic aspects of interpretation to make such declarations unnecessary for example smalltalk which was designed to be interpreted at run time allows generic objects to dynamically interact with each other initially interpreted languages were compiled line by line that is each line was compiled as it was about to be executed and if a loop or subroutine caused certain lines to be executed multiple times they would be recompiled every time this has become much less common most so called interpreted languages use an intermediate representation which combines both compilation and interpretation in this case a compiler may output some form of bytecode which is then executed by a bytecode interpreter examples include python java and perl similarly ruby uses an abstract syntax tree as intermediate representation the intermediate representation can be compiled once and for all like java each time before execution like perl or ruby or each time a change in the source is detected before execution like python language features suiting interpreters well interpreted languages still give programs certain extra flexibility over compiled languages features that are easier to implement in interpreters than in compilers include but are not limited to platform independence java s byte code for example reflective usage of the evaluator e g a first order eval function dynamic typing ease of debugging it is easier to get source code information in interpreted language small program size since interpreted languages have flexibility to choose instruction code

neutral indians and erie tribe as a way of controlling the fur trade even though other reasons are often given for these wars some survivors of these tribes were absorbed into the iroquois tribes modern flag according to francis parkman the iroquois were at the height of their power in the one seven th century with a population of around one two zero zero zero people league traditions allowed for the dead to be symbolically replaced through the mourning war raids intended to seize captives and take vengeance on non members this tradition was common to native people of the northeast and was quite different from european settlers notions of combat the one eight th century in one seven two zero the tuscarora fled north from the european colonization of north carolina and petitioned to become the sixth nation this is a non voting position but places them under the protection of the confederacy during the french and indian war the iroquois sided with the british against the french and their algonquin allies both traditional enemies of the iroquois the iroquois hoped that aiding the british would also bring favors after the war practically few iroquois joined the fighting and at the battle of lake george found a group of mohawk and french ambush a mohawk led british column the british government issued the royal proclamation of one seven six three after the war which restricted white settlement beyond the appalachians but this was mainly ignored by the settlers and local governments during the american revolution the many tuscarora and onondaga sided with the americans while the mohawk seneca and cayuga remained loyal to great britain this marked the first major split among the six nations after a series of successful operations against frontier settlements led by the mohawk leader joseph brant and his british allies the united states reacted with vengeance in one seven seven nine george washington ordered col daniel brodhead and general john sullivan to lead expeditions against the iroquois nations to not merely overun but destroy the british indian alliance the campaign successfully ended the ability of the british and iroquois to mount any further significant attacks on american settlements in one seven nine four the confederacy entered into the treaty of canandaigua with the united states after the american revolutionary war captain joseph brant and the six nations indians left new york to settle in canada as a reward for their loyalty to the english crown they were given a large land grant on the grand river the original mohawk settlement was on the south edge of the present day city at a location favourable for landing canoes brant s crossing of the river gave the original name to the area brant s ford by one eight four seven european settlers began to settle further up the river at a ford in the grand river and named the village brantford ontario beliefs these tribes mostly members of the iroquois nation lived in the northeastern territories of the u s and canada from the st lawrence river down to the delaware bay and inland to the great lakes their close contact with europeans makes investigation of their original mythology and religion extremely difficult but core beliefs included a conception of life as a struggle between the forces of good and evil the all father an all embracing deity was formless and had little contact with humans spirits animated all of nature and controlled the changing of the season key festivals coincided with the major events of the agricultural calendar seventh generation is a precept of the great law of the haudenosaunee six nations iroquois confederacy which requires that chiefs consider the impact of their decisions on the seventh generation in one seven nine nine iroquois prophet handsome lake half brother of cornplanter received a vision and introduced the longhouse religion to the seneca handsome lake s religion fused elements of christianity especially quakerism with traditional iroquois beliefs including seasonal festivals about five zero zero zero people continue to follow the longhouse religion today the haudenosaunee the combined leadership of the nations is known as the haudenosaunee it should be noted that haudenosaunee is the term that the people use to refer to themselves the word iroquois is reputed to come from a french version of a huron wendat name considered an insult meaning black snakes the iroquois were enemies of the huron and the algonquin who were allied with the french due to their rivalry in the fur trade haudenosaunee means people building a long house the term is said to have been introduced by the great peacemaker at the time of the formation of the confederacy it implies that the nations of the confederacy should live together as families in the same longhouse symbolically the seneca were the guardians of the western door of the tribal long house and the mohawk were the guardians of the eastern door there exists another perhaps more compelling version explaining the origin of the word iroquois as the french combination of two distinct terms used in the language of the haudenosaunee the participants and writers developing the nascent us government compared the haudenosaunee and their ways to a state of achievement in administrative self governance that rome itself never reached and an ideal that they hoped the us would aspire to and achieve the iroquois nations political union and democratic government has been credited by some as one of the influences on the united states constitution however that theory has fallen into disfavor among many historians and is regarded by some as mythology historian jack rakove writes the voluminous records we have for the constitutional debates of the late one seven eight zero s contain no significant references to the iroquois member nations note one member of original five nations listed from west to east note two sixth nation joined in one seven two zero iroquois clans within each of the six nations people are divided into a number of matrilineal clans the number of clans varies by nation currently from three to seven with

practical importance because it influences high frequency hf three three zero mhz radio propagation to distant places on the earth geophysics the lowest part of the earth s atmosphere is called the troposphere and it extends from the surface up to about one zero km six miles the atmosphere above one zero km is called the stratosphere followed by the mesosphere it is in the stratosphere that incoming solar radiation creates the ozone layer at heights of above eight zero km five zero miles in the thermosphere the atmosphere is so thin that free electrons can exist for short periods of time before they are captured by a nearby positive ion the number of these free electrons is sufficient to affect radio propagation this portion of the atmosphere is ionized and contains a plasma which is referred to as the ionosphere in a plasma the negative free electrons and the positive ions are attracted to each other by the electromagnetic force but they are too energetic to stay fixed together in an electrically neutral molecule relationship of the atmosphere and ionosphere solar radiation at ultraviolet uv and shorter x ray wavelengths is considered to be ionizing since photons at these frequencies are capable of dislodging an electron from a neutral gas atom or molecule during a collision at the same time however an opposing process called recombination begins to take place in which a free electron is captured by a positive ion if it moves close enough to it as the gas density increases at lower altitudes the recombination process accelerates since the gas molecules and ions are closer together the point of balance between these two processes determines the degree of ionization present at any given time the ionization depends primarily on the sun and its activity the amount of ionization in the ionosphere varies greatly with the amount of radiation received from the sun thus there is a diurnal time of day effect and a seasonal effect the local winter hemisphere is tipped away from the sun thus there is less received solar radiation the activity of the sun is associated with the sunspot cycle with more radiation occurring with more sunspots radiation received also varies with geographical location polar auroral zones mid latitudes and equatorial regions there are also mechanisms that disturb the ionosphere and decrease the ionization there are disturbances such as solar flares and the associated release of charged particles into the solar wind which reaches the earth and interacts with its geomagnetic field the ionospheric layers solar radiation acting on the different compositions of the atmosphere with height generates layers of ionization d layer the d layer is the innermost layer five zero km to nine zero km above the surface of the earth ionization here is due to lyman series alpha hydrogen radiation at a wavelength of one two one five nanometre nm ionizing nitric oxide no in addition when the sun is active with five zero or more sunspots hard x rays wavelength two o two during the night cosmic rays produce a residual amount of ionization recombination is high in this layer thus the net ionization effect is very low and as a result high frequency hf radio waves aren t reflected by the d layer the frequency of collision between electrons and other particles in this region during the day is about one zero million collisions per second the d layer is mainly responsible for absorption of hf radio waves particularly at one zero mhz and below with progressively smaller absorption as the frequency gets higher the absorption is small at night and greatest about midday the layer reduces greatly after sunset but remains due to galactic cosmic rays a common example of the d layer in action is the disappearance of distant am broadcast band stations in the daytime e layer the e layer is the middle layer nine zero km to one two zero km above the surface of the earth ionization is due to soft x ray one one zero nm and far ultraviolet uv solar radiation ionization of molecular oxygen o two this layer can only reflect radio waves having frequencies less than about one zero mhz it has a negative effect on frequencies above one zero mhz due to its partial absorption of these waves the vertical structure of the e layer is primarily determined by the competing effects of ionization and recombination at night the e layer begins to disappear because the primary source of ionization is no longer present this results in an increase in the height where the layer maximizes because recombination is faster in the lower layers diurnal changes in the high altitude neutral winds also plays a role the increase in the height of the e layer maximum increases the range to which radio waves can travel by reflection from the layer es the es layer or sporadic e layer sporadic e propagation is characterized by small clouds of intense ionization which can support radio wave reflections from two five two two five mhz sporadic e events may last for just a few minutes to several hours there are multiple causes of sporadic e that are still being pursued by researchers this propagation occurs most frequently during the summer months with major occurrences during the summer and minor occurrences during the winter during the summer this mode is popular due to its high signal levels the skip distances are generally around one zero zero zero km six two zero miles f layer the f layer or region also known as the appleton layer is one two zero km to four zero zero km above the surface of the earth here extreme ultraviolet uv one zero one zero zero nm solar radiation ionizes atomic oxygen o the f region is the most important part of the ionosphere in terms of hf communications the f layer combines into one layer at night and in the presence of sunlight during daytime it divides into two layers the f one and f two the f layers are responsible for most skywave propagation of radio waves and are thickest and most reflective of radio on the side of the earth facing the sun anomalies to the ideal model the statements above assumed that each layer was smooth and uniform in reality the ionosphere is a lumpy cloudy layer with irregular patches of ionization winter anomaly at mid latitudes the f two layer daytime ion production is higher in the summer as expected since the sun shines more directly on the earth however there are seasonal changes in the molecular to atomic ratio of the neutral atmosphere that cause the summer ion loss rate to be even higher the result is that the increase in the summertime loss overwhelms the increase in summertime production and total f two ionization is actually lower not higher in the local summer months this effect is known as the winter anomaly the anomaly is always present in the northern hemisphere but is usually absent in the southern hemisphere during periods of low solar activity equatorial anomaly electric currents created in sunward ionosphere within approximately two zero degrees of the magnetic equator is the equatorial anomaly it is the occurrence of a trough of concentrated ionization in the f two layer the earth s magnetic field lines are horizontal at the equator solar heating and tidal oscillations in the lower ionosphere move plasma up and across the magnetic field lines this sets up a sheet of electric current in the e region which with the horizontal magnetic field forces ionization up into the f layer concentrating at two zero degrees from the magnetic equator this phenomenon is known as the equatorial fountain ionospheric perturbations x rays sudden ionospheric disturbances sid when the sun is active strong solar flares can occur that will hit the earth with hard x rays on the sunlit side of the earth they will penetrate to the d region release electrons which will rapidly increase absorption causing a high frequency three three zero mhz radio blackout during this time very low frequency three three zero khz signals will become reflected by the d layer instead of the e layer avoiding the signal loss through the d layer as soon as the x rays end the sudden ionospheric disturbance sid or radio black out ends as the electrons in the d region recombine rapidly and signal strengths return to normal protons polar cap absorption pca associated with solar flares is a release of high energy protons these particles can hit the earth within one five minutes to two hours of the solar flare the protons spiral around and down the magnetic field lines of the earth and penetrate into the atmosphere near the magnetic poles increasing the ionization of the d and e layers pca s typically last anywhere from about an hour to several days with an average of around two four to three six hours geomagnetic storms a geomagnetic storm is a temporary intense disturbance of the earth s magnetosphere during a geomagnetic storm the f two layer will become unstable fragment and may even disappear completely in the northern and southern pole regions of the earth aurora will be observable in the sky radio application dx communication popular among amateur radio enthusiasts is a term given to communication over great distances when using high frequency bands the ionosphere is utilized to reflect the transmitted radio beam the beam returns to the earth s surface and may then be reflected back into the ionosphere for a second bounce radio waves hop from the earth to the ionosphere and back to the earth when a radio wave reaches the ionosphere the electric field in the wave forces the electrons in the ionosphere into oscillation at the same frequency as the radio wave some of the radio wave energy is given up to this mechanical oscillation the oscillating electron will then either be lost to recombination or will re radiate the original wave energy back downward again total reflection can occur when the collision frequency of the ionosphere is less than the radio frequency and if the electron density in the ionosphere is great enough the critical frequency is the limiting frequency at or below which a radio wave is reflected by an ionospheric layer at vertical incidence if the transmitted frequency is higher than the plasma frequency of the ionosphere then the electrons cannot respond fast enough and they are not able to re radiate the signal it is calculated as shown below f nine times one zero sqrt where n electron density per cm three and fcritical is in mhz the maximum usable frequency muf is defined as the upper frequency limit that can be used for transmission between two points at a specified time f frac where i angle of attack the angle of the wave relative to the horizon and sin is the sine function the cutoff frequency is the frequency below which a radio wave fails to penetrate a layer of the ionosphere at the incidence angle required for transmission between two specified points by reflection from the layer other applications the open system space tether which uses the ionosphere is being researched the space tether uses plasma contactors and the ionosphere as parts of a circuit to extract energy from the earth s magnetic field by electromagnetic induction measurements ionograms ionograms show the virtual heights and critical frequencies of the ionospheric layers and which are measured by an ionosonde an ionosonde sweeps a range of frequencies usually from zero one to three zero mhz transmitting at vertical incidence to the ionosphere as the frequency increases each wave is refracted less by the ionization in the layer and so each penetrates further before it is reflected eventually a frequency is reached that enables the wave to penetrate the layer without being reflected for ordinary mode waves this occurs when the transmitted frequency just exceeds the peak plasma or critical frequency of the layer tracings of the reflected high frequency radio pulses are known as ionograms solar flux solar flux is a measurement of the intensity of solar radio emissions at a frequency of two eight zero zero mhz made using a radio telescope located in ottawa canada known also as the one zero seven cm flux the wavelength of the radio signals at two eight zero zero mhz this solar radio emission has been shown to be proportional to sunspot activity however the level of the sun s ultraviolet and x ray emissions is primarily responsible for causing ionization in the earth s upper atmosphere we now have data from the goes spacecraft that measures the background x ray flux from the sun a parameter more closely related to the ionization levels in the ionosphere the a and k indices are a measurement of the behavior of the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field the k index uses a scale from zero to nine to measure the change in the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field a new k index is determined at the table mountain observatory north of boulder colorado the geomagnetic activity levels of the earth are measured by the fluctuation of the earth s magnetic field in a unit called gauss the earth s magnetic field is measured around the planet by many observatories the data retrieved is processed and turned into measurement indices daily measurements for the entire planet are made available through an estimate of the ap index called the planetary a index pai scientific research on ionspheric propagation scientists also are exploring the structure of the ionosphere by a wide variety of methods including passive observations of optical and radio emissions generated in the ionosphere bouncing radio waves of different frequencies from it incoherent scatter radars such as the eiscat sondre stromfjord millstone hill arecibo and jicamarca radars coherent scatter radars such as the super dual auroral radar network superdarn radars and using special receivers to detect how the reflected waves have changed from the transmitted waves a veriety of experiments such as project haarp high frequency active auroral research program involve high power radio transmitters to modify the properties of the ionosphere these investigations focus on studying the properties and behavior of ionospheric plasma with particular emphasis on being able to understand and use it to enhance communications and surveillance systems for both civilian and defense purposes haarp was started in one nine nine three for a proposed twenty year experiment the superdarn radar project researches the high and mid latitudes using coherent backscatter of radio waves in the eight two zero mhzrange coherent backscatter is similar to bragg scattering in crystals and involves the constructive interference of scattering from ionospheric density irregularities the project involves more than one one different countries and multiple radars in both hemispheres scientists are also examining the ionosphere by the changes to radio waves from satellites and stars passing through it the arecibo radio telescope located in puerto rico was originally intended to study earth s ionosphere history in one eight nine nine nikola tesla researched ways to utilize the ionosphere to transmit energy wirelessly over long distances in his experiments he transmitted extremely low frequencies between the earth and ionosphere up to what is called the kennelly heaviside layer grotz one nine nine seven tesla made mathematical calculations and computations based on his experiments he predicted the resonant frequency of this area within one five of modern accepted experimental value corum one nine eight six in the one nine five zero s researchers confirmed the resonant frequency was at the low range six eight hz guglielmo marconi received the first trans atlantic radio signal on december one two one nine zero one in st john s newfoundland now in canada using a four zero zero foot kite supported antenna for reception the transmitting station in poldhu cornwall used a spark gap transmitter to produce a signal with a frequency of approximately five zero zero khz and a power of one zero zero times more than any radio signal previously produced the message received was three dots the morse code for the letter s to reach newfoundland the signal would have to bounce off the ionosphere twice dr jack belrose has recently contested this however based on theoretical work as well as an actual experiments however marconi did achieve transatlantic wireless communications beyond a shadow of doubt in glace bay one year later in one nine zero two oliver heaviside proposed the existence of the kennelly heaviside layer of the ionosphere which bears his name heaviside s proposal included means by which radio signals are transmitted around the earth s curvature heaviside s proposal coupled with planck s law of black body radiation may have hampered the growth of radio astronomy for the detection of electromagnetic waves from celestial bodies until one nine three two and the development of high frequency radio transceivers also in one nine zero two arthur edwin kennelly discovered some of the ionosphere s radio electrical properties in one nine one two the u s congress imposed the radio act of one nine one two on amateur radio operators limiting their operations to frequencies above one five mhz wavelength two zero zero meters or smaller the government thought those frequencies were useless this led to the discovery of hf radio propagation via the ionosphere in one nine two three edward v appleton was awarded in one nine four seven a nobel prize for his confirmation of the existence of the ionosphere in one nine two seven lloyd berkner first measured the height and density of the ionosphere this permitted the first complete theory of short wave radio propagation maurice

international auxiliary language association iala in appearance interlingua combines a latin romance vocabulary with a simplified romance grammar and thus it is often referred to as a modernized and simplified latin it is sometimes called iala interlingua to distinguish it from the other uses of interlingua rationale the expansive movements of science technology trade diplomacy and the arts combined with the historical dominance of the greek and latin languages have resulted in a large common vocabulary among western languages interlingua uses an algorithm to extract and standarize the most widespread word or occasionally words for a concept found in a set of control languages english french italian and spanish portuguese with german and russian as secondary references the resulting vocabulary corresponds closely with the neolatin element in the international scientific vocabulary interlingua combines this pre existing vocabulary with a minimalist grammar based on the control languages people with a good knowledge of a romance language or a smattering of a romance language plus a good knowledge of the international scientific vocabulary can frequently read it at first sight because at sight comprehensibility was a design criterion interlingua retains the traditional spelling and morphology of its latinate source material it is for this reason that interlingua is frequently termed a naturalistic ial as opposed schematic ials such as esperanto and ido which are less closely tied to their source languages history international auxiliary language association ultimate credit for interlingua must go to the american heiress alice vanderbilt morris one eight seven four one nine five zero who became interested in linguistics and the international auxiliary language movement in the early one nine two zero s in one nine two three morris and her husband david hennen morris founded the non profit international auxiliary language association in new york their aim was to place the study of ials on a scientific basis iala became a major supporter of mainstream american linguistics funding for example edward sapir s cross linguistic semantic studies of totality one nine three zero and grading phenomena one nine four four morris herself edited sapir and morris swadesh s one nine three two cross linguistic study of ending point phenomena and william edward collinson s one nine three seven study of indication although the morrises provided most of iala s funding it also received support from such prestigious groups as the carnegie corporation the ford foundation and the rockefeller foundation in its early years iala concerned itself with three tasks finding other organizations around the world with similar goals building a library of books about languages and interlinguistics and comparing extant ials including esperanto esperanto ii ido latino sine flexione novial and occidental in pursuit of this last goal it arranged conferences with proponents of these ials debating features and goals of their representative language however with a concession rule that required participants to make a certain number of concessions the debates were forestalled from changing from heated to explosive during the second international interlanguage congress in geneva in one nine three one the iala began to break new ground as its conference was attended and its efforts legitimized by eminent linguists who were not members of the iala one nine three three was a major year for the iala first professor herbert h shenton of syracuse university founded an intense study about the problems that had been encountered in interlanguages when used in international conferences later dr edward l thorndike published a paper about the relative learning speeds of natural and modular constructed languages although neither was a member of the iala both were major influences on its work from then on in one nine three seven the first steps towards the finalization of interlingua were made when a committee of two four linguists from one nine universities around the world published some criteria for an international language and commentary english title however the intended biannual meetings of the committee was cut short by the outbreak of world war ii in one nine three nine development of a new language from the beginning the iala had not set out to create its own language but rather to identify which international language already extant would be the best suited to the task and how best to promote it however after ten years of research more and more members of the iala came to the conclusion that none of the extant interlanguages were up to the task by one nine three seven the decision to create a new language had been arrived at a decision that surprised the world s interlanguage community although much of the debate had been to that point evenly balanced over the decision to use naturalistic e g novial and occidental or systematic e g esperanto and ido words during the war years those supporting a naturalistic interlanguage won out the first support was dr thorndike s paper the second was the concession by those supporting systematic languages that thousands of words were already extant in many or even a majority of the european languages their argument was that systematic derivation of words was a procrustian bed forcing the learner to unlearn and re memorize a new derivation scheme when there was already a usable corpus of vocabulary this finally convinced those who supported systematic languages and the iala from that point assumed the position that a naturalistic language would be best at the outbreak of the second world war iala s research activities were moved from liverpool to new york where e clark stillman established a new research staff stillman with the assistance of dr alexander gode developed a prototyping technique an objective methodology for selecting and standardizing vocabulary based on a comparison of control languages in one nine four three stillman left for war work and gode became acting director of research in one nine four five iala published a general report largely morris s work which presented three models for iala s language model p was a naturalistic model that made no attempt to regularize the prototyped vocabulary model e was lightly schematicized along the lines of occidental model k was moderately schematicized along the lines of ido i e somewhat less schematicized than esperanto from one nine four six four eight the french linguist andr martinet was director of research during this period iala continued to develop models and conducted polling to determine the optimal form of the final language an initial survey gauged reactions to the three models of one nine four five in one nine four six an extensive survey was sent to more than three zero zero zero language teachers and related professionals on three continents four models were canvassed model p and k plus two new models similar to model e of one nine four five model p was unchanged from one nine four five model k was slightly modified in the direction of ido the survey results were surprising the two more schematic models c and k were rejected k overwhelmingly of the two naturalistic models m attracted somewhat more support than p taking national biases into account for example the french who were polled disproportionately favored model m iala decided on a compromise between models m and p with certain elements of c finalization upon martinet s resignation in one nine four eight to take up a position at columbia university gode took on the last phase of interlingua s development his task was to combine elements of model m and model p while taking the flaws seen in both by the polled community and repairing them with elements of model c as necessary while simultaneously developing a vocabulary the vocabulary and verb conjugations of interlingua were initially published in one nine five one in one nine five one the iala published the finalized grammar a two seven zero zero zero word dictionary interlingua to english only and an introductory book entitled interlingua a prime vista interlingua at first sight an early practical application of interlingua was the scientific newsletter spectroscopia molecular published one nine five two one nine eight zero in one nine five four interlingua was employed at the second world cardiological congress in washington dc for both written summaries and oral interpretation within a few years it found similar use at nine further medical congresses between the mid one nine five zero s and the late one nine seven zero s some thirty scientific and especially medical journals provided article summaries in interlingua science news service the publisher at the time of science newsletter published a monthly column in interlingua from the early nineteen fifties until gode s death in one nine seven zero interlingua today today interlingua is promoted primarily by the union mundial pro interlingua president barbara rubinstein sweden secretary general petyo angelov bulgaria periodicals and books are produced by various national organizations including the societate american pro interlingua president dr stanley mulaik and the svenska s llskapet f r interlingua secretary ingvar stenstr m currently panorama in interlingua is the most prominent interlingua periodical it is a two eight page newsletter published bimonthly that covers news science and editorials interlingua has seen a resurgence over the last decade thanks to the internet with the number of speakers jumping tenfold by some estimates vocabulary the iala set up a control group of five widely known languages with much shared vocabulary grouped into four units french italian spanish portuguese treated as one unit and english a word is eligible for interlingua if it occurs with similar meanings in three of these four units secondary controls are originally german and russian self explanatory compounds can be included with support from at least one source language grammatical words required to operate the language are taken from latin if this procedure fails the forms of interlingua words are based on the historical or hypothetical forms from which the national forms evolved derivational series are also considered though french oeil italian occhio spanish ojo and portuguese olho eye are quite different they descend from a historical form oculus this and international derivatives like ocular and oculista determine the form oculo to be used in interlingua new words can be created internally through derivational affixes or extracted from the control languages in the manner of the original vocabulary internal word building though freer than in the control languages is more restricted than in schematic ials such as esperanto and ido most interlingua dictionaries include only words with support in the control languages interlingua as now used tends to have less classical latin vocabulary than the iala s original version replaced in part by southern romance vocabulary for example emer to buy has been mostly replaced by comprar sed but with ma or mais and nimis too with troppo however other classical latin words such as pro for contra against post after and ergo therefore are retained because they are seen as more internationally understandable than their romance counterparts phonology and spelling the pronunciation is similar to ecclesiastical latin for the most part the consonants are like english while the vowels are like spanish or italian four vowel pairs ai au eu oi are pronounced as falling diphthongs notable exceptions are as follows c is soft before e i or y otherwise hard ch is most often and is used before e i or y or in words of greek origin in many words especially of french origin it has the sound of english sh choc chenille chef

gatos negros black cats since this feature is absent in english nor progressive verb tenses english i am reading since they are absent in french the definite article le is invariable as in english nouns have no grammatical gender and are pluralised by adding s es after a final consonant hes after a final c pronouns take nominative oblique and genitive cases most adverbs are derived from adjectives by adding a mente the verb system is a simplified version of the systems found in english and the romance languages except optionally for esser to be there are no personal inflections and the indicative also covers the subjunctive and imperative moods three common verbs usually take short forms in the present tense a few other irregular verb forms are available though little used there are four simple tenses moods the present past and future tenses and the conditional mood and four compound tenses moods voices the past and future tenses the conditional mood and the passive voice these compound structures employ an auxiliary plus the infinitive or the past participle simple and compound tenses can be combined in various ways to express more complex tenses e g nos haberea morite we would have died word order is essentially subject verb object except that pronouns often follow the romance pattern subject object verb io les vide i see them adjectives may precede or follow the nouns they modify the position of adverbs is flexible though constrained by common sense community estimates of the number of speakers of interlingua range from as few as one zero zero to as many as one zero zero zero zero the majority of conservative estimates however place the number of active users of interlingua at between one zero zero zero and one five zero zero there are no known native speakers interlingua has active supporters in north and south america europe particularly scandinavia and russia there are interlingua web pages including editions of wikipedia and wikitionary and several periodicals including panorama in interlingua from the union mundial pro interlingua umi and the magazines of the national societies allied with it there are several active mailing lists and interlingua is also in use in certain usenet newsgroups particularly in the europa hierarchy in recent years samples of interlingua have also been seen in music and anim every two years the umi organizes an international conference in a different european country the most recent conference two zero zero five in sweden was attended by slightly over two five zero people in the year between the scandinavian interlingua societies co organize a conference in sweden interlingua may well be the most widely spoken international auxiliary language ial after esperanto although the estimated number of speakers overlaps with that of ido it is also claimed to be the most widely understood ial by virtue of its naturalistic as opposed to schematic grammar and vocabulary allowing those familiar with one of the primary control languages to read and understand it with little study criticisms and controversies like any project of such scope interlingua has generated some heated discussion both among interlingua users and among non users frequently proponents of other auxiliary languages some common criticisms and their common responses are noted below some say that interlingua is too romance in its grammar and vocabulary and is not fair towards germanic languages its defenders note that the romance languages being based on latin have the advantage in the linguistic impact of the old roman empire which is still seen today in that a romance language is spoken on five out of seven continents the only germanic languages with an international scope are english which is already a primary language and german which is already a secondary language however spanish which has a very regular grammar and inflectional system compared to other romance languages and is quite easy for english speakers to learn has threatened to obviate the need for not only interlingua but esperanto and ido especially in the united states where spanish is the most common second language studied in fact there is debate in the interlingua community as to expanding the language s sources to other languages see in interlingua for an overview of the debate others note that interlingua being european in nature is primarily of use to europeans interlingua supporters point out that esperanto despite being based on slavic germanic and romance languages has some of its strongest communities in china and japan where the local languages are totally unrelated to the indo european languages see color argument finally some argue that esperantists outnumber interlingua users to such a degree estimates range from five zero one to one zero zero zero one that anyone interested in promoting an auxiliary language should support esperanto instead supporters counter that it is a lot easier to understand interlingua without training than esperanto because interlingua uses the most widespread words of the romance languages whereas esperanto makes up many of its own words according to internal rules for example one can speak interlingua with anyone who knows italian or spanish one will even be understood by portuguese speakers but will have difficulty understanding them whereas if one tries to communicate in esperanto to speakers of these other languages one will have very limited success samples the lord s prayer also available as an mp three file

needles and alum bay the rest of the island landscape also has great diversity with perhaps the most notable habitats being the soft cliffs and sea ledges which are spectacular features as well as being very important for wildlife and are internationally protected the river medina flows north into the solent whilst the other main river the river yar flows roughly north east emerging at bembridge harbour on the eastern end of the island confusingly there is another entirely separate river at the western end also called the river yar flowing the short distance from freshwater bay to a relatively large estuary at yarmouth where distinguishing the two becomes necessary each may be referred to as the eastern or western yar the south coast of the island adjoins the english channel

valley complex which consisted of much of the current southern coast of england the swamps and ponds of the region at that time made the island excellent for the preservation of fossils and means that it is now one of the richest locations for finding dinosaurs in europe for more information see the dinosaurs of the isle of wight article the isle of wight became an island sometime after the end of the last ice age when post glacial rebound caused the land level to sink the solent flooding and separating the island from the mainland the island was part of celtic britain and known to the romans as vectis captured by vespasian in the roman invasion after the roman era the isle of wight was settled by the jutes a germanic tribe in the early stages of the anglo saxon invasions the latter s corruption of vectis into wiht the latin v was pronounced w is the root of the island s name memorial to charles i at carisbrooke castle the norman conquest created the position of lord of the isle of

distinctive isle of wight accent is a somewhat stronger version of the traditional hampshire dialect featuring the dropping of some consonants and an emphasis on longer vowels this is similar to the west country drawl heard in south western england but less removed in sound from the estuary english of the south east the spread of the latter in general together with continuing immigration means the broader accent is more prevalent in the older population the island also has its own lexical style some words like grockel visitor and nipper nips addressing a younger person are commonly used and are shared with neighbouring regions others are unique for example overner a mainlander who has settled on the island other words are more obscure being little used outside some of the families long resident on the island such as mallishag meaning caterpillar and nammit meaning food industry and agriculture the largest industry on the isle of wight is tourism but the island has a strong agricultural heritage including sheep dairy farming and arable crops traditional agricultural commodities are more difficult to market off the island because of transport costs but island farmers have managed to successfully exploit some specialist markets the high price of these products overcomes the transport costs one of the most successful agricultural sectors at present is crops grown undercover particularly salad crops including tomatoes and cucumbers the isle of wight has a longer growing season than much of britain and this also favours such crops garlic has been successfully grown in newchurch for many years and is even exported to france this has led to the establishment of an annual garlic festival at newchurch which is one of the largest events of the island s annual calendar the favourable climate has led to the success of vineyards including one of the oldest in the british isles at adgestone near sandown lavender is also grown for its oil the making of sailcloth boats and other connected maritime industry has long been associated with the island although somewhat diminished in recent years although they have reduced the extent of the plants and workforce including the sale of the main site gkn operate what was once the british hovercraft corporation a subsidiary of and latterly when manufacturing focus changed known as westland aircraft

holiday the latter has been in decline in the uk domestic market due to the increased affordability of air travel to alternative destinations tourism is still the largest industry on the island as well as more traditional tourist attractions the island is often host to walking or cycling holidays through the attractive scenery almost every town and village on the island plays host to hotels hostels and camping sites out of the peak summer season the island is still an important destination for coach tours from other parts of britain and an annual walking festival has attracted considerable interest transport and communications ferry routes and main roads there are three ferry companies which operate routes between the mainland and the island red funnel operates a car and

underground rolling stock a sign used to greet visitors to the island disembarking from the car ferry at fishbourne stating island roads are different please drive carefully it is a joke amongst local residents that the reason island roads are different is due to a lack of maintenance by the council nevertheless the lighter traffic quieter roads and slower speeds are noticeable to the visitor and are one of the reasons the island has remained attractive to tourists from the busier mainland there are two small airfields for general aviation at sandown and bembridge these are busy with day trippers in summer all of the island telephone exchanges are broadband enabled and in addition some urban areas such as cowes and newport are covered by cable lines the isle of wight county press is

ipa or irish gaelic this has generally been the common name for the language in the irish diaspora within ireland proper it has inevitably acquired political significance referring to the language as gaelic suggests that the language is as distant and unrelated to modern irish life as the civilization of the ancient gaels calling it irish on the other hand indicates that it is and should be the proper national language of the irish people and this is the generally accepted term among scholars and in the irish constitution some unionists insist that gaelic is the correct term as dialects of the language are also spoken in parts of scotland and insist that the term irish language is an invention by irish nationalists to justify separatist claims from the rest of the british isles use of the term irish also avoids confusion with scottish gaelic g idhlig and manx gaelic gaelg the closely related languages spoken in scotland and the isle of man and often referred to in english as simply gaelic ipa or the archaic term erse originally a scots form of the word irish is no longer used and in most contexts is also considered derogatory it is a fact however that as late as the early part of the one eight th century the scottish highlanders still referred to their native language as irish as witnessed by a letter dated two one july one seven one three from a young campbell john lord glenorchy at christ church oxford to his grandfather john earl of breadalbane at taymouth i still take care about my irish and some times meet with sir donald macdonald s son who is here and another

union beginning january one two zero zero seven gaeltacht there are pockets of ireland where irish is spoken as a traditional native language these regions are known as the gaeltacht these are in county galway contae na gaillimhe including connemara conamara and the aran islands na hoile in rann on the west coast of county donegal contae dh n na ngall in the part which is known as tyrconnell t r chonaill and corca dhuibhne on the dingle peninsula in county kerry contae chiarra smaller ones also exist in mayo contae mhaigh eo meath contae na m waterford contae phort l irge and cork contae chorca however even within the gaeltacht areas the irish speaking populations have declined since the gaeltacht boundaries were drawn up the numerically and socially strongest gaeltacht areas are those of south conamara the extreme west of corca dhuibhne and in and north west t r chonaill in which a significant proportion of residents use irish as a community language and in which children often speak the language among each other these areas are often refered to as the f or ghaeltacht f or true and collectively have a population of just under one zero zero zero zero of which over eight zero use the language daily the highest proportions of daily irish speakers in the community are found in ros muc connemara over nine one and around bloody foreland cnoc na fola in t r chonaill eight eight eight nine dialects there are a number of distinct dialects of irish roughly speaking the three major dialect areas coincide with the provinces of munster c ige mumhan connacht c ige chonnacht and ulster c ige uladh munster dialects munster irish is spoken in the gaeltachta of kerry contae chiarra muskerry m scra cape clear oile n cl ire in the western part of county cork contae chorca and the tiny pocket of irish speakers in an rinn near dungarvan d n garbh in in county waterford contae phort l irge the most important subdivision in munster is that between decies irish spoken in waterford and the rest of munster irish some typical features of munster irish are the use of personal endings instead of pronouns with verbs thus i must is in munster caithfead while other dialects prefer caithfidh m m means i i was and you were is bh os agus bh s in munster but bh m agus bh t in other dialects in front of nasals and ll some short vowels are lengthened while other are diphthongised a copula construction involving is ea is frequently used connacht dialects the strongest dialect of connacht irish is to be found in connemara and the aran islands in some regards this dialect is quite different from general connacht irish but since most connacht dialects have died out during the last century connemara irish is sometimes seen as connacht irish much closer to the traditional connacht irish is the very threatened dialect spoken in the region on the border between galway gaillimh and mayo maigh eo the irish of tourmakeady tuar mhic adaigh in southern mayo maigh eo theas and joyce country d thaigh sheoige are considered the living irish dialects closest to middle irish also the northern mayo dialect of erris iorras and achill acaill is in grammar and word building essentially a connacht dialect but shows an affinity in vocabulary with ulster irish due to large scale immigration of dispossessed people following the plantation of ulster connemara irish is very popular with learners thanks to m che l siadhail s self teaching textbook learning irish however there are features in connemara irish outside the official standard notably the preference for verbal nouns ending in achan such as lagachan instead of lag weakening the non standard pronunciation with lengthened vowels and heavily reduced endings give connemara irish its distinct sound the distinguishing features of this dialect include the prounouncing of bh as w rather than as v in other parts of the country for example ni raibh is pronounced ni raow in connacht as opposed to ni rev elsewhere in addition connacht speakers tend to put the we pronoun at the end of the verb rather than with the verb itself for example bhi muid is used for we were instead of bhiomar elsewhere this has become a common teaching practice in schools as it is a much easier construction of any verb in the we form connacht irish tends to be more widespread than any other dialect as most irish teachers tend to come from there although obviously there are many exceptions ulster dialects the most important of the ulster dialects today is that of the rosses na rosa which has been used extensively in literature by such authors as the brothers s amus grianna and seosamh mac grianna locally known as jim fheilim and joe fheilim this dialect is essentially the same as that in gweedore gaoth dobhair inlet of streaming water the same dialect used by native speaker enya eithne and her siblings in clannad clann as dobhar family from the water ulster irish sounds very different and shares several unusual features with scottish gaelic as well as having lots of characteristic words and shades of meanings however since the demise of those irish dialects spoken natively in what is today northern ireland it is probably an exaggeration to see ulster irish as an intermediary form between scottish gaelic and the southern and western dialects of irish indeed scottish gaelic does have lots of non ulster features in common with munster irish too one noticeable trait of ulster irish is the use of the negative participle cha n in place of the munster and connaught version n even in ulster cha n most typical of scottish gaelic has ousted the more common n only in easternmost dialects including the now defunct ones once spoken in what is now northern ireland the practice seems to be that cha n is most usually used when answering to a statement either confirming a negative statement n l aon mhaith ann chan fhuil leoga it is no good indeed it isn t or contesting an affirmative one t s go maith chan fhuil it is good no it isn t while n is preferred in answering a question an bhfuil aon mhaith ann n l is it any good no other regions the dialects of irish native to leinster the fourth province of ireland became extinct during the two zero th century but records of some of these were made by the irish folklore commission among other bodies prior to this the present day irish of meath in leinster is a special case it belongs to the connemara dialect as the irish speaking community in meath is simply a group of mostly connemara speakers who moved there in the one nine three zero s after a land reform campaign spearheaded by m irt n cadhain subsequently one of the greatest modernist writers in the language in areas outside the traditional gaeltacht where standard irish was learnt in schools this has become the dialect of learners of the language what has been called dublin irish or gaelscoil irish has also arisen that is irish poorly learnt and heavily influenced by english english idioms are translated directly e g tabhair suas for give up when the verb lig should be used english grammar is sometimes used straight when not applicable to irish often when the speaker doesn t know a word the english will be substituted sometimes with il affixed il is generally an ending for the verbal noun of a verb but when added to an english word this becomes the stem e g v t il many b arlachas false irish based on english words and phrases are used e g pioc s rt saghas f ar pl etc also typical interjection words often used in english and especially english influenced by america are used e g like man so etc are used un translated in irish students in the eastern part of ireland tend to pronounce the irish words in an english way rather than in a gaelic way this is possibly due to teaching inconsistency the average irish student would have twelve or thirteen different irish teachers each with a varying dialect comparisons the differences between dialects are considerable and have led to recurrent difficulties in defining standard irish even everyday phrases can show startling dialectal variation the standard example is how are you ulster cad mar at t what is it as you are note caid or goid and sometimes d are alternative renderings of cad connacht c n chaoi a bhfuil t what way is it that you are munster conas tao how are you standard irish conas a t t how are you in recent times however contacts between speakers of different dialects have become more common and mixed dialects have originated nevertheless many dialect speakers especially ulster are still jealously trying to guard their own variety against influences from other dialects among non native speakers this can be seen as a quest for authenticity regional accents are commonly taught to non natives and imitated an urban non native speaker of irish in cork city cathair chorca is very probably trying to emulate coolea or kerry dialect one from belfast b al feirste tends to speak an irish modelled on the rosses dialect of donegal and galwegian irish speakers living next door to connemara will do their best to sound like a connemara native shelta there also exists a cant called shelta based partly on english and partly irish in use by the irish travellers linguistic structure the features most unfamiliar to english speakers of the language are the orthography the initial consonant mutations the verb subject object word order and the use of two different forms for to be however initial mutations are found in other celtic languages as well as in some italian and sardinian dialects as an independent development they are also found in some west african languages syntax see main article irish syntax one aspect of irish syntax that is unfamiliar to speakers of other languages is the use of the copula known in irish as an chopail the copula is used to describe what or who someone is as opposed to how and where this has been likened to the

morphology irish nominals and irish verbs another feature of irish grammar that is shared with other celtic languages is the use of prepositional pronouns forainmneacha r amhfhoclacha which are essentially conjugated prepositions for example the word for at is ag which in the first person singular becomes agam at me when used with the verb b to be ag indicates possession this is the equivalent of the english verb to have compare with breton orthography and pronunciation see main articles irish orthography and irish phonology the written language looks rather daunting to those unfamiliar with it once understood the orthography is relatively straightforward the acute accent or s neadh fada serves to lengthen the sound of the vowels and in some cases also changes their

translations department of the irish government issued his own guidelines about how to standardise irish spelling and grammar this de facto standard was subsequently approved of by the state and called the official standard or caighde n oifigi il it simplified and standardised the orthography many words had silent letters removed and vowel combination brought closer to the spoken language

gaoluinn or gaolainn is still used in books written in dialect by munster authors or as a facetious name for the munster dialect lughbhaidh l louth biadh bia food the orthography biadh is still used by the speakers of those dialects that show a meaningful and audible difference between biadh nominative case and b dh genitive case of food food s for example in munster irish the latter ends in an audible g sound because final idh igh regularly delenites to ig in munster pronunciation modern irish has only one diacritic sign the acute known in irish as the s neadh fada long mark plural s nte fada in english this is frequently referred to as simply the fada where the adjective is used as a noun the dot above diacritic called a ponc s imhithe or s buailte often shortened to buailte derives from the punctum delens which was used in medieval manuscripts to indicate deletion similar to crossing out unwanted words in handwriting today from this usage it was used to indicate the lenition of s from s to h and f from f to zero in old irish texts lenition of c p and t was indicated by placing the letter h after the affected consonant lenition of other sounds was left unmarked later both methods were extended to be indicators of lenition of any sound except l and n and two competing systems were used lenition could be marked by a buailte or by a postposed h eventually use of the buailte predominated when texts were writing using gaelic letters while the h predominated when writing using roman letters today gaelic letters and the buailte are rarely used except where a traditional style is required e g the motto on the university college dublin coat of arms or the symbol of the irish defence forces the irish defence forces cap badge glai na h ireann letters with the

stages of the irish language the introduction of irish to ireland dates from some time after one two zero zero bc two the earliest form of the language primitive irish is found in ogham inscriptions up to about the four th centuryad after the conversion to christianity old irish begins to appear as glosses in the margins of latin manuscripts beginning in the six th century until it gives way in the one zero th century to middle irish modern irish dates from about the one six th century irish language movement the irish language was the most widely spoken language on the island of ireland until the one nine th century the first bible in irish was translated by william bedell church of ireland bishop of kilmore in the one seven th century though its number of speakers has been in decline since the one nine th century it is an important part of irish nationalist identity a combination of the introduction of a primary education system the national schools in which irish was prohibited and only english taught by order of the british government and the great famine an gorta m r which hit a disportionately high number of irish language speakers who lived in the poorer areas heavily hit by famine deaths and emigration hastened its rapid decline irish political leaders such as daniel o connell d nall conaill too were critical of the language seeing it as backward with english the language of the future contemporary reports spoke of irish speaking parents actively discouraging their children from speaking the language and encouraging the use of english instead this practice continued long after independence as the stigma of speaking irish remained very strong despite the policy of successive irish governments to promote the language the decline in the number of native speakers within the gaeltacht has accelerated although the number of those elsewhere in the country able to speak it as a second language has increased albeit not to the extent that many hoped some however thought differently the initial moves to save the language were championed by irish protestants such as the linguist and clergyman william neilson in the end of the eighteenth century the major push occurred with the foundation by douglas hyde the son of a church of ireland rector of the gaelic league known in irish as conradh na gaeilge which started the gaelic revival leading supporters of conradh included p draig mac piarais and amon de valera the revival of interest in the language coincided with other cultural revivals such as the foundation of the gaelic athletic association and the growth in the performance of plays about ireland in english by such luminaries as william butler yeats j m synge sean o casey and lady gregory with their launch of the abbey theatre even though the abbey theatre playwrights wrote in english and indeed some disliked irish the irish language affected them as it did all irish english speakers the version of english spoken in ireland known as hiberno english bears striking similarities in some grammatical idioms with irish some have speculated that even after the vast majority of irish people stopped speaking irish they perhaps subsconsciously used its grammatical flair in the manner in which they spoke english this fluency is reflected in the writings of yeats george bernard shaw oscar wilde and more recently in the writings of seamus heaney paul durcan dermot bolger and many others it may also in part explain the appeal in britain of irish born broadcasters like terry wogan eamonn andrews graham norton desmond lynam etc this national cultural revival of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century matched the growing irish radicalism in irish politics many of those such as pearse de valera w t cosgrave liam mac cosguir and ernest blythe earn n de blaghd who fought to achieve irish independence and came to govern the independent irish state first became politically aware through conradh na gaeilge though hyde himself resigned from its presidency in one nine one five in protest at the movement s growing politicisation a church of ireland campaign to promote worship and religion in irish was started in one nine one four with the founding of cumann gaelach na heaglaise the irish guild of the church the roman catholic church also replaced its liturgies in latin with irish and english for their liturgies following the second vatican council in the one nine six zero s independent ireland and the language the independent irish state was established in one nine two two the irish free state one nine two two three seven ireland ire from one nine three seven also known since one nine four nine as the republic of ireland although some republican leaders had been committed language enthusiasts the new state continued to use english as the language of administration even in areas where over eight zero of the population spoke irish the government refused to implement the one nine two six recommendations of the gaeltacht commission which included restoring irish as the language of administration in such areas as the role of the state grew it therefore exerted tremendous pressure on irish speakers to speak english this was only partly offset by measures which were supposed to support the irish language for instance the state was by far the largest employer a qualification in irish was required to apply for state jobs however this did not require a high level of fluency and few public employees were ever required to use irish in the course of their work on the other hand state employees had to have perfect command of english and had to use it constantly because most public employees had a poor command of irish it was impossible to deal with them in irish if an irish speaker wanted to apply for a grant obtain electricity or complain about being over taxed they had to do it in english as late as one nine eight six a bord na gaeilge report noted the administrative agencies of the state have been among the strongest forces for anglicisation in gaeltacht areas page four one of the irish language in a changing society shaping the future author advisory planning committee of bord na gaeilge published by criterion in one nine eight six the new state increased attempts to promote irish through the school system some politicians claimed that the state would become predominantly irish speaking within a generation however it is generally agreed that this policy was clumsily implemented and sometimes proved even to be counter productive from the mid one nine four zero s onward the policy of teaching english speaking children through irish was abandoned in the following decades support for the language was progressively reduced whereas the first three presidents of ireland douglas hyde dubhghlas de h de sean t o kelly se n t ceallaigh and eamon de valera and the fifth cearbhall d laigh were all so fluent in irish that it became the working language in their official residence later presidents struggled with any degree of fluency its use declining to such an extent that it is only used now if at all in occasional speeches similarly where earlier generations of irish government leaders were highly fluent recent prime ministers albert reynolds ailbhe mag raghnaill john bruton bertie ahern had little fluency struggling to pronounce passages of their speeches in irish to their ard fheiseanna party conference s it is though disputed to what extent such professed language revivalists as de valera genuinely tried to gaelicise political life ernest blythe did little during his time as minister of finance to assist irish language projects beyond the vested interests of already established organisations even in the first d il ireann few speeches were delivered as gaeilge in irish with the exception of formal proceedings none of the recent taoisigh plural of taoiseach meaning prime minister have been fluent in irish however the two most recent presidents mary mcaleese m ire mhic ghiolla osa and mary robinson m ire mhic r ib n are fluent though the latter studied the language while in office to improve her fluency every president of ireland has all so far taken their inaugurational declaration of office in the language but they have the option of taking the english declaration at the inauguration even modern parliamentary legislation though supposed to be issued in both irish and english is frequently only available in english much of publicly displayed irish is ungrammatical thus irritating both language activists and enemies of the language and contributing to the public image of the revival as phony and bogus many public bodies have irish language or bilingual names but some have downgraded the language for example eircom formerly telecom ireann effectively dropped irish from its telephone directories in one nine nine nine an post the republic s postal service continues to have place names in the language on its postmarks as well as recognising addresses as does the royal mail in northern ireland in an effort to address the half committed attitude of irish language use by the state the official languages act was passed in two zero zero three this act ensures that every publication made by a governmental body must be published in both official languages irish and english in addition the office of language commissioner has been set up to act as an ombudsman with regard to equal treatment in both languages picture of a typical irish road sign with placenames in english and irish in two zero zero two at the launch of what was to be a new traffic management system for dublin it was revealed that the vast majority of signs would be in english only the justification offered was that in making the english lettering large enough to be easily read by motorists from a distance there was no space to include irish the use of the single irish words left an l r meaning city centre was criticised on the basis that no one would know what it meant even though it was a term used widely for decades on street signs even the once common method in ireland of beginning and ending letters beginning a chara meaning friend and ending is mise le meas is becoming rarer a major factor in the decline of spoken irish has been the movement of english speakers into the gaeltacht predominantly irish speaking areas and the return of native irish speakers who have acquired english speaking families this has been stimulated by government grants and infrastructure projects only about half gaeltacht children learn irish in the home this is related to the high level of in migration and return migration which has accompanied the economic restructuring of the gaeltacht in recent decades page xxvi of the irish language in a changing society shaping the future many see this as a deliberate attempt by anti nationalist politicians to wipe out the language that economic development of the kind undertaken was likely to have such consequences was readily predictable a decade ago p four seven in a last ditch effort to stop the complete collapse of irish speaking in connemara in galway planning controls have been introduced on the building of new homes in irish speaking areas these are supposed to ensure that the proportion of english speakers in the local population does not increase but even this may be too little too late as many of those areas have a majority of english speakers with all irish speakers being bilingual using english as their everyday language except among themselves attempts have been made to offer some support for the language through the media notably the launch of raidi na gaeltachta gaeltacht radio and teilif s na gaeilge irish language television called initially tnag now renamed tg four both have been relatively successful tg four has offered irish speaking young people a forum for youth culture as gaeilge in irish through rock and pop shows travel shows dating games and even a controversial award winning soap opera in irish called ros na r n featuring among other characters an irish speaking gay couple and their child most of tg four s viewership however tends to come from showing gaelic football hurling and rugby matches and films in english there is also a daily irish language newspaper called l a weekly called foinse and the irish times and daily ireland have pages in irish with articles appended with short lists giving the meaning of some of the words used in english more controversially the official language required the use of both the irish and english placenames in english speaking areas of the state but only allows for the use of irish placenames on all official documents maps and roadsigns in or referring to what are often only nominally gaeltacht areas opposition to these measures comes from several quarters including some people within popular tourist destinations located within the gaeltacht such as dingle an daingean who complain that tourists may not recognise the gaelic forms of the placenames in one nine three eight the founder of the conradh na gaeilge douglas hyde was inaugurated as the first president of ireland the record of his delivering his inauguration declaration of office in his native roscommon irish remains almost the only surviving remnant of

tuaisceart na h ireann tuaisceart ireann or na s chontae the six counties attitudes towards the language in northern ireland have traditionally reflected the political differences between its two divided communities the language has been regarded with suspicion by unionists who have associated it with the catholic dominated republic and more recently with the republican movement many republicans in northern ireland including sinn f in president gerry adams learnt irish while in prison a development known as the jailtacht although the language was taught in catholic secondary schools especially by the christian brothers it was not taught at all in state protestant schools and public signs in irish were effectively banned under laws by the parliament of northern ireland which stated that only english could be used these laws were not repealed by the british government until the early one nine nine zero s however irish medium schools known as gaelscoileanna had already been founded in belfast and derry and an irish language newspaper called l day was established in belfast bbc radio ulster began broadcasting a nightly half hour programme in irish in the early one nine eight zero s called blas taste accent and bbc northern ireland also showed its first tv programme in the language in the early one nine nine zero s the ultach trust was also established with a view to broadening the appeal of the language among protestants although hardline loyalists like ian paisley continued to ridicule it as a leprechaun language ulster scots promoted by many loyalists was in turn ridiculed by nationalists and even some unionists as a diy language for orangemen according to recent statistics there is no significant difference between the number of catholic and protestant speakers of ulster scots in ulster see ulster scots language although those involved in promoting ulster scots as a language are almost always unionist although ulster scots is now officially recognised as a language in northern ireland there are also some attempts to promote it in some border counties of the republic many people claim it is actually little more than a dialect of english irish received official recognition in northern ireland for the first time in one nine nine eight under the good friday agreement a cross border body known as foras na gaeilge was established to promote the language in both northern ireland and the republic taking over the functions of the previous republic only bord na gaeilge the british government has ratified the european charter for regional or minority languages in respect to irish in northern ireland it has been claimed that belfast now represents the fastest growing centre of irish language usage on the island and the good friday agreement s provisions on parity of esteem have been used to give the language an official status there in march two zero zero five the irish language tv service tg four began broadcasting from the divis transmitter near belfast as a result of agreement between the department of foreign affairs and the northern ireland office although so far this is the only transmitter to carry it irish language today the number of native irish speakers in the republic of ireland today is a tiny fraction of what it was at independence the official languages act of two zero zero three gave people the right to interact with state bodies in irish it is too early to assess how well this is working in practice other factors were outward migration of irish speakers from the gaeltacht and inward migration of english speakers the planning and development act two zero zero zero attempted to address the latter issue but the response is almost certainly inadequate planning controls now require new housing in gaeltacht areas to be allocated to english speakers and irish speakers in the same ratio as the existing population of the area this will not prevent houses allocated to irish speakers subsequently being sold on to english speakers outward migration of irish speakers could be reduced if the state which is the main employer in the republic of ireland were to exercise its right to have certain jobs performed in irish and relocated to the gaeltacht on three rd december two zero zero three the minister for finance announced a new decentralisation programme moving over one zero zero zero zero civil and public service jobs to five three locations in two five other counties outside dublin the government explicitly said this was being done to boost the economy of outlying areas none of these jobs were used to provide employment for native irish speakers in the gaeltacht according to data compiled by the irish department of community rural and gaeltacht affairs only one quarter of households in gaeltacht areas possess a fluency in irish the author of a detailed analysis of the survey donncha h allaithe described the irish language policy followed by irish governments a complete and absolute disaster the irish times january six two zero zero two referring to his analysis which was initially published in the irish language newspaper foinse quoted him as follows it is an absolute indictment of successive irish governments that at the foundation of the irish state there were two five zero zero zero zero fluent irish speakers living in irish speaking or semi irish speaking areas but the number now is between two zero zero zero zero and three zero zero zero zero according to the language survey levels of fluency among families is very low from one in galway suburbs to a maximum of eight parts of west donegal with such sharp decline particularly among the young the real danger exists that irish will largely become extinct within two generations possibly even one while the language will continue to exist among english speakers who have learned fluency and are bilingual though mainly english speaking in their everyday lives gaeltachta embody more than just a language but the cultural context in which it is spoken through song stories social traditions folklore and dance the death of the gaeltachta would make a break forever between ireland s cultural past and identity and its future all sides irrespective of their view on the methodology used by independent ireland in its efforts to preserve the language agree that such a loss

openoffice org and microsoft windows xp irish in education the irish language is a compulsory subject in government funded schools in the republic of ireland and has been so since the early days of the state while many students learn irish well through the irish school system and develop a healthy respect for it many other students find it difficult are taught it poorly by unmotivated teachers these students attitudes toward irish tend to range from apathy to hostility all things being equal for english speakers irish is more difficult than spanish or german irish syntax morphology and vocabulary are a good deal more different to english than many other european languages are this makes learning it challenging for many the irish government has endeavoured to address the situation by revamping the curriculum at primary school level to focus on spoken irish however at secondary school level it can easily be argued that irish is still taught academically students must write lengthy essays debates and stories in irish in the leaving certificate exam recently the abolition of compulsory irish has been discussed and while some irish people favour such a move many do not in two zero

criticism from many quarters although some such as the reform movement have supported his call mr kenny despite being a fluent speaker himself stated that he believed that compulsory irish has done the language more harm than good a relatively recent development is the proliferation of gaelscoileanna i e schools in which irish is the medium of education by september two zero zero five there were

message protocol icmp is one of the core protocols of the internet protocol suite it is chiefly used by networked computers operating systems to send error messages indicating for instance that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached icmp differs in purpose from tcp and udp in that it is usually not used directly by user network applications one exception is the ping tool which sends icmp echo request messages and receives echo response messages to determine whether a host is reachable and how long packets take to get to and from that host technical details the internet control message protocol icmp is part of the internet protocol suite as defined in rfc seven nine two icmp messages are typically generated in response to errors in ip datagrams as specified in rfc one one two two or for diagnostic or routing purposes the version of icmp for internet protocol version four is also known as icmpv four as it is part of ipv four ipv six has an equivalent protocol icmp messages are constructed at the ip layer usually from a normal ip datagram which has generated an icmp response ip encapsulates the appropriate icmp message with a new ip header to get the icmp message back to the original sending host and transmits the resulting datagram in the usual manner for example every machine such as intermediate routers that forwards an ip datagram has to decrement the time to live ttl field of the ip header by one if the ttl reaches zero an icmp time to live exceeded in transit message is sent to the source of the datagram each icmp message is encapsulated directly within a single ip datagram and thus like udp icmp does not guarantee delivery although icmp messages are contained within standard ip datagrams icmp messages are usually processed as a special case distinguished from normal ip processing rather than processed as a normal sub protocol of ip in many cases it is necessary to inspect the contents of the icmp message and deliver the appropriate error message to the application which generated the original ip packet the one which prompted the sending of the icmp message many commonly used network utilities are based on icmp messages the traceroute command is implemented by transmitting udp datagrams with specially set ip ttl header fields and looking for icmp time to live exceeded in transit above and

mathematics the inverse limit also called the projective limit is a construction which allows one to glue together several related objects the precise manner of the gluing process being specified by morphisms between the objects inverse limits can be defined in any category but we will initially only consider inverse limits of groups formal definition algebraic objects we start with the definition of an inverse system of groups and homomorphisms let i be a directed poset not all authors require i to be directed let a i i i be a family of groups and suppose we have a family of homomorphisms f ij a j a i for all i j note the order with the following properties f ii is the identity in a i f ik f ij o f jk for all i j k then the set of pairs a i f ij is called an inverse system of groups and morphisms over i we define the inverse limit of the inverse system a i f ij as a particular subgroup of the direct product of the a i s varprojlim a i big a i big a i f a j mbox i leq j big the inverse limit a comes equipped with natural projections i a a i which pick out the i th component of the direct product the inverse limit and the natural projections satisfy a universal property described in the next section this same construction may be carried out if the a i s are sets rings modules over a fixed ring algebras over a fixed field etc and the homomorphisms are homomorphisms in the corresponding category the inverse limit will also belong to that category general definition the inverse limit can be defined abstractly in an arbitrary category by means of a universal property let x i f ij be an inverse system of objects and morphisms in a category c same definition as above the inverse limit of this system is an object x in c together with morphisms i x x i called projections satisfying i f ij o j the pair x i must be universal in the sense that for any other such pair y i there exists a unique morphism u y x making all the obvious identities true i e the diagram image inverselimit zero one png must commute for all i j the inverse limit is often denoted x varprojlim x i with the inverse system x i f ij being understood unlike for algebraic objects the inverse limit may not exist in an arbitrary category if it does however it is unique in a strong sense given any another inverse limit x there exists is a unique isomorphism x x commuting with the projection maps we note that an inverse system in category c admits an alternative description in terms of functors any partially ordered set i can be considered as a small category where the morphisms consist of arrows i j iff i j an inverse system is then just a contravariant functor i c examples the ring of p adic integers is the inverse limit of the rings z p n z see modular arithmetic with the index set being the natural numbers with the usual order and the morphisms being take remainder the natural topology on the p adic integers is the same as the one described here pro finite groups are defined as inverse limits of finite discrete groups let the index set i of an inverse system x i f ij have a greatest element m then the natural projection m x x m is an isomorphism inverse limits in the category of topological spaces are given by placing the initial topology on the underlying set theoretic inverse limit let i be the trivial order not directed the inverse limit of any corresponding inverse system is just the product let i consist of three elements i j and k with i j and i k not directed the inverse limit of any corresponding inverse system is the pullback related concepts and generalizations the categorical dual of an inverse limit is a direct limit or inductive limit more general concepts are the limits and colimits of category theory the terminology is somewhat confusing inverse limits are limits while direct limits are colimits category theory abstract algebra by definition interplanetary travel is travel between bodies in a given star system current achievements in interplanetary travel nasa s apollo program landed twelve people on the moon and returned them to earth apollo one one one seven except one three i e six missions each with three astronauts of which two landed on the moon robot probes have been sent to fly past most of the major planets of the solar system the most distant probe spacecraft pioneer one zero pioneer one one voyager one and voyager two are on course to leave the solar system but will cease to function long before reaching the oort cloud robot landers such as viking and pathfinder have already landed on the surface of mars and several venera and vega spacecraft have landed on the surface of venus the near shoemaker orbiter successfully landed on the asteroid four three three eros even though it was not designed with this maneuver in mind orbital mechanics of interplanetary travel to date the only form of spacecraft propulsion used for interplanetary missions is the chemical rocket engine the limitations of this engine dictate the trajectories and travel times required for interplanetary travel all objects in a star system are in orbit around the star if they were not they would have left the system or fallen into the star long ago this implies that one cannot simply point oneself at another planet and fly in that direction because upon arrival the planet will be moving at an inappropriate relative velocity or may have moved altogether for instance if a spacecraft were to start from the earth and fly to mars its final velocity will be close to earth s orbital velocity which is much higher than that of mars this is because any spacecraft starting on a planet is also in orbit around the sun and a brief glance at the planetary speeds and distances demonstrates that the power of a chemical rocket pales in comparison to the relative speeds of the planets in order to make interplanetary travel possible a reduction in the total amount of energy needed to do so is required for many years this meant using the hohmann transfer orbit hohmann demonstrated that the lowest energy transfer between any two orbits is to elongate the orbit so that its apogee lies over the orbit in question once the spacecraft arrives a second application of thrust will re circularize the orbit at the new location in the case of planetary transfers this means adjusting the spacecraft originally in an orbit almost identical to earth s such that the apogee is on the far side of the sun near the orbit of the other planet a spacecraft traveling from earth to mars via this method will arrive near mars orbit in approximately one eight months but because the orbital velocity is greater when closer to the center of mass ie the sun and slower when farther from the center the spacecraft will be travelling quite slowly and a small application of thrust is all that is needed if the manoeuver is timed properly mars will be arriving under the spacecraft when this happens the hohmann transfer applies to any two orbits not just those with planets involved for instance it is the most common way to transfer satellites into geostationary orbit after first being parked in low earth orbit however the hohmann transfer takes an amount of time similar to one two of the orbital period of the outer orbit so in the case of the outer planets this is many years too long to wait it is also based on the assumption that the points at both ends are massless as in the case when transferring between two orbits around earth for instance with a planet at the destination end of the transfer calculations become considerably more difficult one technique known as the gravitational slingshot uses the gravity of the planets to modify the path of the spacecraft without using fuel in typical example a spacecraft is sent to a distant planet on a path that is much faster than what the hohmann transfer would call for this would typically mean that it would arrive at the planet s orbit and continue past it however if there is a planet between the departure point and the target it can be used to bend the path toward the target and in many cases the overall travel time is greatly reduced a prime example of this are the two craft of the voyager program which used slingshot effects to change trajectories several times in the outer solar system this method is not easily applicable to earth mars travel however although it is possible to use other nearby planets such as venus or even the moon as slingshots another technique uses the atmosphere of the target planet to slow down in this case the spacecraft is sent on a high speed transfer which would normally mean it would go right past its target upon arrival by passing into the atmosphere this extra speed is lost and the amount of energy lost to transport the weight of the required heat shield is considerably less than the weight of the rocket fuel that would be needed to provide the same amount of energy this concept known as aerobraking was first used on the apollo program wherein the returning spacecraft did not bother to re enter earth orbit in a transfer and instead re entered immediately at the end of the journey similar systems are included on most basic plans for a manned mission to mars recent advances in computing have allowed old mathematical solutions to be re investigated and have led to a new system for calculating even lower cost transfers paths have been calculated which link the lagrange points of the various planets into the so called interplanetary transport network the transfers on this system are slower than hohmann transfers but use even less energy and are particularly useful for sending spacecraft between the inner planets improved methods there are a number of designs for more efficient spacecraft propulsion methods as measured by specific impulse that could speed up interplanetary space missions greatly and allow greater design safety margins by reducing the imperative to make spacecraft lighter if developed such designs would use trajectories far different to hohmann transfers the most likely near term development is that of electric propulsion which uses an external source such as a nuclear reactor to generate electricity which is then used to accelerate a chemically inert propellant to speeds far higher than achieved in a chemical rocket a prototype of this technology has already been used on nasa s deep space one a more ambitious nuclear powered version was intended for an unmanned jupiter mission the jupiter icy moons orbiter originally planned for launch sometime in the next decade due to a shift in priorities at nasa that favored manned space missions the project lost funding in two zero zero five effectively cancelling the jimo mission see the spacecraft propulsion article for a discussion of a number of other technologies that could in the medium to longer term be the basis of interplanetary missions unlike the situation with interstellar travel the barriers to fast interplanetary travel involve engineering and economics rather than any basic physics while manned interplanetary travel with the arguable exception of the apollo program has not yet been achieved a trip to mars is probably feasible even with chemical rocket propulsion and could probably be achieved within a decade at most two if the funds were made available nasa s design reference mission proposes a mars exploration program costing five zero billion but others have made detailed proposals with projected costs much less see mars direct interference of two circular waves wavelength decreasing bottom to top and wave centers distance increasing to the right absolute value snapshots of the real valued scalar wave field as time progresses the wave fronts would move outwards from the two centers but the dark regions destructive interference stay fixed interference is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pattern as most commonly used the term usually refers to the interference of waves which are correlated or coherent with each other either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency two non monochromatic waves are only fully coherent with each other if they both have exactly the same range of wavelengths and the same phase differences at each of the constituent wavelengths the principle of superposition of waves states that the resultant displacement at a point is equal to the sum of the displacements of different waves at that point if a crest of a wave meets a crest of another wave at the same point then the crests interfere constructively and the resultant wave amplitude is greater if a crest of a wave meets a trough then they interfere destructively and the overall amplitude is decreased interference is involved in thomas young s double slit experiment where two beams of light which are coherent with each other interfere to produce an interference pattern the beams of light both have the same wavelength range and at the center of the interference pattern they have the same phases at each wavelength as they both come from the same source more generally this form of interference can occur whenever a wave can propagate from a source to a destination by two or more paths of different length two or more sources can only be used to produce interference when there is a fixed phase relation between them but in this case the interference generated is the same as with a single source see huygens principle light from any source can be used to obtain interference patterns for example newton s rings can be produced with sunlight however in general white light is less suited for producing clear interference patterns as it is a mix of a full spectrum of colours that each have different spacing of the interference fringes sodium light is close to monochromatic and is thus more suitable for producing interference patterns most suitable is laser light because that is almost perfectly monochromatic constructive and destructive interference interference pattern produced with a michelson interferometer bright bands are the result of constructive interference while the dark bands are the result of destructive interference when two waves superimpose the resulting waveform depends on the frequency or wavelength amplitude and relative phase of the two waves if the two waves have the same amplitude a and wavelength the resultant waveform will have amplitude between zero and two a depending on whether the two waves are in phase or out of phase consider two waves that are in phase with amplitudes a one and a two their troughs and peaks line up and the resultant wave will have amplitude a a one a two this is known as constructive interference if the two waves are one eight zero out of phase then one wave s crests will coincide with another wave s troughs and so will tend to cancel out the resultant amplitude is a a one a two if a one a two the resultant amplitude will be zero this is known as destructive interference see also beat acoustics moir pattern interferometer external

which can only be tried on an indictment after a preliminary hearing to determine whether there is a prima facie case to answer or by a grand jury in trials for indictable offences the accused normally has the right to a jury trial unless he or she waives that right in the united states a crime of similar severity is usually referred to as a felony although it too proceeds after an indictment in english law the term refers to either way and indictable only offences an either way or hybrid offence allows the defendant to elect between trial by jury on indictment in the crown court and summary trial in the magistrates court however the election may be overruled by the court of first instance if the facts suggest that the sentencing powers of a magistrates court would be inadequate to represent the seriousness of the offence some offences such as murder and rape are considered so serious that they can only be tried on indictment at the crown court where the widest range of sentencing powers is available to the judge see also summary offence felony indictment crimes criminal law common law internazionale milano football club is an italian football club based in milan lombardy which plays in the serie a it is more commonly known as inter and often named inter milan in foreign countries the club wears the recognisable blue and black stripes with the current sponsors pirelli on their shirt history pre first world war the club was founded on march nine one nine zero eight following a schism from the milan cricket and football club now known as ac milan a group of italians and swiss were unhappy about the domination of italians in the ac milan team and broke away from them leading to the creation of internazionale from the beginning the club was open to foreign players and thus lived up to her founding name the original nickname of the team in the milano dialect was la beneamata the cherished the club won its very first championship in one nine one zero and its second in one nine two zero the captain and the coach of the first scudetto was virgilio fossati born in milan and brother of giuseppe fossati who won the second inter championship unfortunately virgilio fossati died during the first world war between the wars during the turbulent period between the first and second world wars internazionale was forced to change its name to ambrosiana inter in order to accommodate the requests of benito mussolini s fascist regime however inter was still used to winning ways and captured its third league championship in the new italian first division in one nine three zero following that a fourth league title was won in one nine three eight inter s first coppa italia italian cup was won in one nine four zero and a fifth league championship followed in one nine four zero from one nine four two onwards the name ambrosiana inter was dropped in favour of the original internazionale milano la grande inter following the war inter won its sixth championship in one nine five three and the seventh in one nine five four following these titles inter was to enter the best years of its history affectionately known as the era of la grande inter the great inter during this magnificent period the club won three league championships in one nine six three one nine six five both players agreed to move to inter but politics intervened the military dictatorships of portugal and brazil both refused to sanction the moves and both transfers fell through in one nine six seven inter lost one two in the final of the european cup against celtic f c one nine seven zero to date following the golden one nine six zero s inter managed to win their one one th league title in one nine seven one and their one two th in one nine eight zero inter were defeated for the second time in five years in the final of the european cup going down zero two to johan cruijff s ajax amsterdam in one nine seven two during the one nine seven zero s in addition they didn t finish the championship in one nine zero eight the current honorary president and owner of inter is massimo moratti his father angelo moratti was the president of inter during the golden era of the one nine six zero s massimo trying to emulate his father s great success has spent a great deal of money to bring some of the world s best players to the club without managing to secure that elusive fourteenth championship rivalry inter have two very great rivalries the first is obviously cross town arch enemies a c milan inter is derived from ac milan so their rivalry has been in existence since creation during the one nine six zero s inter was the more successful club however in recent times ac milan has been the more dominant team another rival of inter is juventus f c matches between these two teams are called the derby d italia san siro the stadium in which inter plays is called stadio giuseppe meazza also known as san siro since the stadium is in the san siro district it was previously simply known as san siro but a new name was adopted in one nine eight zero after giuseppe meazza s death meazza was a famous player for fc internazionale in the one nine three zero s and also played for ac milan for a brief period of time as a player he won two world cups for italy in one nine three four and one nine three eight and alongside giovanni ferrari remains one of only two italian players to have ever won the fifa world cup on two occasions as a result he is revered amongst the interisti inter fans and was honored by having one of the most famous football stadiums in the world named after him the stadium seats eight five seven zero zero and plays host to both fc internazionale and ac milan current first team squad as of january three one two

interferons ifns are natural proteins produced by the cells of the immune systems of most animals in response to challenges by foreign agents such as viruses bacteria parasites and tumor cells interferons belong to the large class of glycoproteins known as cytokines types in humans there are three major classes of interferon ifn the human type i ifns consists of one three different alpha isoforms subtypes with slightly different specificities ifna one two four five six seven eight one zero one three one four one six one seven two one and single beta ifnb one omega ifnw one epsilon ifne one and kappa ifnk isoforms homologous molecules are found in many species including rats and mice and most mammals and have been identified in birds reptiles amphibians and fish species in addition to these ifns ifn zeta limitin in mice ifn nu in cats ifn tau in ruminants and ifn delta in pigs have been identified all type i ifns bind to a specific cell surface receptor complex known as ifnar consisting of ifnar one and ifnar two chains the type ii ifns consists of ifn gamma ifng its sole member the mature ifng ligand is an anti parallel homodimer and it binds to the ifng receptor ifngr complex which is made up of two of each ifngr one and ifngr two subunits the recently discovered three rd class consists of ifn lambda with three different isoforms il two nine il two eight a il two eight b and signal through a receptor complex consisting of il one zero r two and ifnlr one while there are evidence to suggest other signaling mechanisms exist the jak stat signaling pathway is the best characterised and commonly accepted ifn signaling pathway principles in a majority of cases the production of interferons is induced in response to microbes such as viruses and bacteria and their products viral glycoproteins viral rna bacterial endotoxin flagella cpg dna as well as mitogens and other cytokines for example interleukin one interleukin two interleukin one two tumor necrosis factor and colony stimulating factor that are synthesised in the response to the appearance of various antigens in the body their metabolism and excretion take place mainly in the liver and kidneys they hardly pass the placenta and the blood brain barrier interferon alpha and beta are produced by many cell types including t cells and b cells macrophages fibroblasts endothelial cells osteoblasts and others and are an important component of the anti viral response they stimulate both macrophages and nk cells interferons alpha and beta are also active against tumors interferon gamma is involved in the regulation of the immune and inflammatory responses in humans there is only one type of interferon gamma it is produced in activated t cells interferon gamma has some anti viral and anti tumor effects but these are generally weak however interferon gamma potentiates the effects of interferon alpha and interferon beta however interferon gamma must be released at the site of a tumor in very small doses at this time interferon gamma is not very useful for treating cancer interferon gamma is also released by th one cells and recruits leukocytes to a site of infection resulting in increased inflammation it also stimulates macrophages to kill bacteria that have been engulfed the interferon gamma released by th one cells is also important in regulating the th two response as interferon gamma is vitally implicated in the regulation of immune response its production can lead to autoimmune disorders interferon omega is released by leukocytes at the site of viral infection or tumors pharmacological uses three vials filled with human leukocyte interferon interferon was scarce and expensive until one nine eight zero when the interferon gene was inserted into bacteria using recombinant dna technology allowing mass cultivation and purification from bacterial cultures interferon beta one a is produced in mammalian cells several different types of interferon are now approved for use in humans and interferon therapy is used in combination with chemotherapy and radiation as a treatment for many types of systemic cancer when used in the systemic therapy ifn and ifn are mostly administered by an intramuscular injection the injection of interferons in the muscle in the vein or under skin is generally well tolerated the most frequent side effects are flu like symptoms increased body temperature feeling ill fatigue headache muscle pain and convulsion erythema pain and hardness on the spot of injection are also frequently observed rarely patients experience their hair falling out dizziness and depression all known effects are reversible and disappear a few days after the therapy has been finished interferon alpha was approved by the united states food and drug administration fda on february two five one nine nine one as a treatment for hepatitis c several different forms of interferon alpha including interferon alpha two a interferon alpha two b and interferon alfacon one are approved for the treatment of viral hepatitis interferon alfa two b is also used for chronic myelogenous leukemia more than half of hepatitis c patients treated with interferon respond with better blood tests and better liver biopsies there is some evidence that giving interferon immediately following infection can prevent hepatitis c however people infected by hepatitis c often do not display symptoms until months or years later more recently the fda approved pegylated interferon alpha in which polyethylene glycol is added to make the interferon last longer in the body pegylated interferon alpha two b was approved in january two zero zero one pegylated interferon alpha two a was approved in october two zero zero two the pegylated form is injected once weekly rather than three times per week for conventional interferon alpha used in combination with the antiviral drug ribavirin pegylated interferon produces sustained cure rates of seven five or better in people with genotype two or three hepatitis c which is easier to treat and about five zero in people with genotype one which is most common in the u s and western europe interferon beta interferon beta one a and interferon beta one b is used in the treatment and control of the neurological disorder multiple sclerosis by an as yet unknown mechanism interferon beta inhibits the

israeli settlements in israel proper see settlements in israel israeli settlements are communities built for israeli jewish settlers in areas that it captured during the one nine six seven six day war these areas are the west bank east jerusalem the golan heights and formerly the sinai peninsula and the gaza strip the settlements have been declared illegal under international law by the united nations security council and the international court of justice a position shared by a majority of un member states but not a unanimous view among all international law scholars for example the late julius stone argued that they were legal under international law the israeli policy of sponsoring supporting and or tolerating the establishment of such settlements is one of the most contentious issues in the israeli palestinian conflict in two zero zero four the israeli government announced its unilateral disengagement plan to dismantle all settlements in the gaza strip as well as four settlements in the west bank the withdrawal was completed on september one two two zero zero five terminology terms commonly used to describe this matter are themselves controversial they include settlers are people who have migrated from the land of their birth to live permanently in colonies controlled militarily by their home country in modern history the word settlers is synonymous with terms like pioneers colonists or as british people once called them colonials settlement vs community there is broad agreement that the term settlement implies that these are recently established places and therein lies the controversy although many israelis concede that the term settlement is apt for these reasons others argue that these are re established communities built on jewish towns and villages that were vacated by force as late as one nine four eight or much earlier they also point out that these are highly dissimilar places see below and that using one term is misleading in hebrew the common term for the israeli settlements outside the green line is hitnakhluyot hebrew singular hitnakhlut or hitnakhalut this term is broadly used in the media and in public although some think it has acquired a derogatory shade in recent years settlers are called mitnakhalim hebrew singular mitnakhel the settlers themselves and their right wing sympathizers prefer the term yishuvim singular yishuv for settlements and mityashvim hebrew singular mityashev for settlers which are more neutral as they also refer to settlements inside israel proper some think these terms are a euphemism in arabic the term for settlements is mustawtanaat arabic and settlers are mustawtineen arabic west bank vs judea and samaria the term west bank dates from the time that jordan controlled the area in question one nine four eight one nine six seven but is still by far the most common name used in the english speaking world and by international organizations such as the un the terms judea and samaria english for yehuda and shomron are historical terms that relate to the political geography of the roman era jewish dominion in the area palestinians strongly object to the terms judea and samaria the use of which they deem to reflect israeli expansionist aims among palestinians the specific area is referred to as the west bank but is commonly known as palestine or part of the palestinian territories occupied vs disputed vs territories the legal status of the areas is a much debated question see below and drives the choice of qualifier for them historical background the cease fire agreement following the one nine six seven six day war left israel in control of a number of areas captured during hostilities from jordan israel gained control of the entire western bank of the jordan river including parts of jerusalem previously controlled by jordan east jerusalem and the west bank from egypt israel gained control of the entire sinai peninsula up to the suez canal and the gaza strip from syria israel gained control of most of the golan heights original israeli policy at that time was to deny any jewish settlement of these areas or even jewish resettlement of specific locations where jews had resided up until the one nine four eight arab israeli war such as the jewish villages listed in this list of villages depopulated during the one nine four eight arab israeli war such as kfar etzion many attempts were made by gush emunim to establish outposts or resettle former jewish areas and the israeli government forcibly removed these attempts in the beginning but in the absence of peace talks to determine the future of these and other disputed territories israel implemented different policies on their use and did not enforce the original ban on settling the municipal borders of jerusalem were extended in one nine six seven to include all of the old city as well as other areas residents within the new municipal borders were offered the choice between citizenship if they met israeli requirements for naturalization and permanent residency if they wished to retain their jordanian passports this annexation was not recognized by most countries the golan heights were under israeli military administration until one nine eight one when israel similarly extended its law there imposed permanent residency and id cards on the residents and offered them the possibility of citizenship this annexation was also not recognized by most countries the sinai gaza and the rest of the west bank were put under israeli military administration residents were not offered citizenship or residency though they typically had de facto work permits within israel and freedom of travel in the absence of a final peace settlement the continued israeli administration of areas captured in one nine six seven is in itself subject to continuing international concern and criticism however it is the establishment of israeli homes and communities in those areas that has often generated condemnation israel evacuated her citizens from the sinai and demolished their homes when the area was returned to egypt pursuant to the camp david accords since the golan heights was originally part of the british mandate in palestine the remaining areas in question largely cover the original british mandate that was left after the establishment of the hashemite kingdom of jordan

various statistics the population distribution can be estimated including sinai according to israeli government statistics just under four zero zero zero zero zero israelis lived in territories captured during the one nine six seven war as of november two zero zero zero this number is controversial as it includes a large number of israeli citizens who live in east jerusalem which was once along with most of western jerusalem proposed by the united nations to be an international zone under un administration former compromise proposal resolution one eight one ii of two nine november one nine four seven which the arab states rejected however if the boundaries of that peace plan were used then the number of israeli settlers would be far greater including inhabitants of the galilee the southwest and many other areas maps of west bank settlements since the oslo accords one nine nine three the settlers number on the west bank excluding east jerusalem has doubled from one one five zero zero zero to two three zero zero zero zero communities established on the sites of previous recent jewish communities some of the three two three settlements were established on sites that had been

israel in the one nine six seven six day war israel claims that they fall into three different categories east jerusalem jerusalem and its surroundings were envisioned as an international area under un administration in the one nine four seven partition plan in one nine four eight jordan captured and annexed the eastern half of jerusalem while israel captured and annexed the west following the war in one nine six seven israel annexed the eastern part together with several villages around it the golan heights which were captured from syria in one nine six seven have been similarly annexed by israel the gaza strip and west bank a section of the areas awarded by the un to a prospective arab state of palestine remained in arab hands while the rest of that area was taken by israel the former was administered by egypt while the latter was annexed by jordan egypt supported palestinian efforts against israel while jordan regarded itself as the legitimate representative of the palestinians the annexations of east jerusalem and the golan heights have both been deemed illegal by the un security council resolutions two six seven and four nine seven respectively and have not been recognized by other states israel has signed peace treaties with egypt returning the sinai peninsula to egyptian sovereignty and jordan returning small sections to jordanian sovereignty there are currently no peace treaties governing israel s borders related to the west bank the gaza strip and the golan heights israel therefore asserts that the armistice lines known as the green line of one nine four nine have no other legal status palestinians object to this view as the israel jordan peace treaty was not to alter the status of any territories coming under israeli control during the hostilities of one nine six seven article three two of the israel jordan peace treaty motivations for settlements complicating this issue a number of reasons are cited from both sides for the establishment of settlements palestinians argue that the policy of settlements constitute an effort to pre empt or even sabotage a peace treaty that includes palestinian sovereignty and claim that the settlements are built on land that belongs to palestinians the un various european governments a vocal israeli minority and many ngos view settlements similarly arguing that they violate international law by making life difficult for palestinians in the areas prior to the eruption of the israeli palestinian conflict in the late eighties even until the signing of the israeli jordanian peace treaty in one nine nine four israeli governments on the left and right argued that the settlements were of strategic and tactical importance the location of the settlements was primarily chosen based on the threat of an attack by the bordering hostile countries of jordan syria and egypt and possible routes of advance into israeli population areas many israelis still argue that the settlements are of strategic and tactical importance disrupting terrorist activities many israelis assert the historical jewish connection to at least some of the areas in dispute arguing that their claim is at least equal to that of the palestinians most religious jews assert the biblical jewish connection to the areas in dispute arguing that their claim to build is equal to the biblical jewish connection to the other areas in israel as it turns out the settlers themselves have varying reasons for choosing to reside where they do while some live in the territories out of religious and or political idealism and the lower price of rural real estate others were attracted by tax incentives that were given in general to israelis living in rural periphery areas but these were revoked entirely in two zero zero three land grab accusations israel claims that the majority of the land currently taken by the new settlements was either vacant belonging to the state from which it was leased or bought fairly from the palestinians arguing that there is nothing illegal about acquiring land in these ways further israel argues that these lands were conquered in a defensive war and are held legitimately as reparation opponents dispute at least one of these bases saying that vacant land had either belonged to arabs who had fled or was communal land that had belonged collectively to an entire village that practice had formed under ottoman rule although the british and the jordanians have unsuccessfully tried to stop it since the late one nine two zero s b tselem an israeli ngo claims that the israeli government used the absence of modern legal documents for the communal land as an excuse to seize it altogether around four two of the area of the west bank total of about two four zero zero km is controlled by israelis see map ms word format report international and legal background the fourth geneva convention forbids an occupying power to transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies article four nine six this tractate is frequently cited by those who believe it establishes the illegality of the settlements israel argues that west bank and gaza have never been part of a sovereign state since the defeat of the ottoman empire apparently considering the annexation of the west bank by jordan as invalid and do not therefore meet the definitions of the geneva conventions article two israel argues further that even if they did the settlements are not intended to nor have ever resulted in the displacement of palestinians from the area in addition the geneva conventions only apply in the absence of an operative peace agreement and between two powers accepting the geneva convention since the oslo accords leave the issue of settlements to be negotiated later israel argues that there is no basis for declaring them illegal israel has little international support for this view and the application of the fourth geneva convention to the territories has been determined by the international court of justice which in an advisory opinion to the un general assembly argued that according to article two of the geneva convention the convention applies if there exists an armed conflict between two contracting parties regardless of the territories status in international law prior to the armed attack it also argued that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal according to customary international law and defined by declaration on principles of international law concerning friendly relations and co operation among states in accordance with the charter of the united nations general assembly resolution two six two five it should be noted that advisory opinions are not binding verdicts and the ruling has been disputed by some international law scholars the establishment and expansion of israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza strip has also been described as illegal by the un security council many times for example in resolutions four four six four five two four six five and four seven one since resolutions four four six and four six five were not made under chapter vii of the united nations charter israel argued that they held no binding force under international law and chose not to heed them some scholars have lately argued that security council resolutions outside of chapter vii can also be considered legally binding upon member states the security council itself takes great care to make the distinction in its resolutions israel further points out that in the oslo accords the palestinians accepted the temporary presence of israeli settlements pending further negotiation therefore the violent attacks carried out by palestinians against settlements are not only wrong because of settlers being civilians a claim others dispute but also constitute a breach of the oslo accords these attacks however are frequently carried by organizations such as hamas which do not accept the oslo accords the settlements have also been frequently denounced by prominent international human rights groups such as amnesty international and human rights watch tensions mistrust and accusations the settlements have on several occasions been a source of tension between israel and the u s in one nine nine one there was a clash between the bush administration and israel where the u s delayed a subsidized loan in order to pressure israel not to proceed with the establishment of settlements for instance in the jerusalem bethlehem corridor jimmy carter has said that the settlements constitute a major obstacle to peace the current bush administration while generally supportive of israel has said that settlements are unhelpful to the peace process that they violate united states policy and prejudges the outcome of future negotiations although president bush has put forward the view that major israeli population centers needs to be taken into account when determining final borders generally u s efforts have at most temporarily delayed further expansion of established israeli communities in the territories u s public opinion is also divided the strongest support for the israeli position can be found among evangelical christians public opinion outside the u s and israel strongly opposes israeli settlement and expansion of communities in the territories although the oslo accords did not include any obligation on israel s part to stop building in the settlements palestinians argue that israel has undermined the oslo accords and the peace process more generally by continuing to expand the settlements after the signing of the accords palestinians and others regularly accuse israel of attacking refugee camps and villages in an attempt to scare off palestinians and claim the land as theirs israel justifies these attacks by saying that it only fights against terrorist organisations and if there were no terrorists there would be no military operations israel previously also had settlements in the sinai but these were withdrawn as a result of the peace agreement with egypt most proposals for achieving a final settlement of the middle east conflict involve israel dismantling a large number of settlements in the west bank and gaza strip most israeli and us proposals for final settlement have also involved israel being allowed to retain long established communities in the territories near israel and in east jerusalem the majority of the settler population is near the green line with israel annexing the land on which the communities are located this would result in a transfer of roughly five of the west bank to israel with the palestinians being compensated by the transfer of a similar share of israeli territory i e territory behind the green line to the palestinian state palestinians complain that this would legitimize what they see as an illegitimate land grab and that the land offered in exchange is situated in the southern desert whereas the areas that israel seeks to retain are among the west bank s most fertile areas including major aquifers israel however sees the current green line as unacceptable from a security standpoint israel would have at some points no more than one seven kilometers from the border to the sea which was an important motivation for the placing of these settlements for more details about the issues at stake see proposals for a palestinian state dismantlement of settlements given the dispute over the territories where the settlements were built the issue of dismantling them has been considered arab parties to the conflict have demanded the dismantlement of the settlements as a condition for peace with israel as part of the israel egypt peace treaty israel was required to evacuate its settlers from the sinai the evacuation which took place in one nine eight two was done forcefully in some instances such as the evacuation of yamit the settlements were demolished as it was feared that settlers may try to return to their homes after the evacuation during the peace process with the palestinians the issue of dismantling the west bank and gaza strip settlements has been raised although never officially discussed in the oslo accords many israelis believed that a final status accord would require the dismantlement of at least some of these communities as part of the disengagement plan israel has evacuated the gaza strip and part of the west bank including all two one settlements in gaza and four in the west bank while retaining control over gaza s borders coastline and airspace most of these settlements have existed since the early eight zero s some are over three zero years old and with a total population of more than one zero zero zero zero there was significant opposition to the plan among parts of the israeli public and especially those living in the territories american president george w bush has said that a permanent peace deal would have to reflect demographic realities in the west bank regarding israel s settlements some israelis believe the settlements need not necessarily be dismantled and evacuated even if israel withdraws from the territory where they stand as they can remain under palestinian rule these ideas have been expressed both by people from the left who see this as a possible situation in a two state solution and by extreme right wingers and settlers that while object to any withdrawal claim stronger links to the land than to the state of israel such ideas are not widely accepted in israel and most israelis consider an evacuation of settlements inevitable in territories israel withdraws from the sasson report sasson delivering her report an official israeli government report published on march eight two zero zero five has revealed that israeli state bodies have been secretly diverting millions of shekels to build west bank settlements and outposts which were illegal under israeli law the report commissioned by prime minister ariel sharon was headed by the former head of the state prosecution criminal department talia sasson the report details how officials in the ministries of defence and housing and the settlement division of the world zionist organization spent millions of shekels from state budgets to support the illegal outposts ms sasson called it a blatant violation of the law and said drastic steps were needed to rectify the situation it describes secret cooperation between various ministries and official institutions to consolidate wildcat outposts which settlers began erecting more than a decade ago sasson added that the problem is ongoing saying the process of outpost expansion is profoundly under way the report states the housing ministry supplied four zero zero mobile homes for outposts on private palestinian land the defence ministry approved the positioning of trailers to begin new outposts the education ministry paid for nurseries and their teachers the energy ministry connected outposts to the electricity grid roads to outposts were paid for with taxpayers money the report mentions one five zero communities in the west bank with incomplete or nonexistent permits but sasson cautions that this list is not exhaustive due to the lack of cooperation of some ministries and government offices which she says failed to hand over some important documents she has recommended that the housing ministry be stripped of authority over construction of settlements in the west bank and that this power be transferred to the cabinet the housing minister at the time of the tabling the report isaac herzog labour said following the release of the report that every expense earmarked for the settlements would subsequently need the approval of the ministry s director general up until then the heads of each department at the ministry had been able to sign off on expenses for various construction and infrastructure matters at the settlements the report is seen as potentially embarrassing to the prime minister because when he was foreign minister under binyamin netanyahu in one nine nine eight he publicly urged settlers to seize hilltops in order to break up the contiguity of palestinian areas and prevent the establishment of a palestinian state as reported by the bbc saying let everyone get a move on and take some hilltops whatever we take will be ours and whatever we don t take will not be ours the report explicitly ignored sharon s complicity and his name is absent from the report settler leaders have rejected criticism of illegality and wrong doing protesting that they were participating in officially sanctioned community planning initiatives settler leader shaul goldstein said mr sharon should be the one to face questioning over the report s findings adding it s obvious that the one who sent us in order to protect the roads and land is the prime minister so he should look in the mirror mr sharon has to be questioned not us it remains to be seen whether the prime minister and other former and current government officials will face any legal repercussions for their alleged official involvement in the funding of illegal settlements as peace now and other groups have called for according to the haaretz newspaper herzog claimed that the main responsibility for the building of illegal outposts in recent years falls with my predecessor effi eitam and his director general he also added that when he took up the position earlier this year he ordered that no funds be transferred to the illegal outposts as well as the establishment of a joint defense ministry and prime minister s office team to coordinate the budgets for the settlements eitam replied in reaction to the report and the associated comments saying that all illegal outposts he had approved during his time in office were approved in coordination with prime minister ariel sharon had his full backing and were sometimes initiated by him eitam claimed that talia sasson was not an objective surveyor and that the report was politically motivated sasson has recommended that sharon consider criminal investigations against those suspected of involvement deputy defence minister zeev boim formely likud told israeli army radio that the outposts must be removed but that the government s plan to withdraw from gaza had priority over any dismantling of illegal outposts in the west bank at a cabinet meeting on march one three the government restated its commitment to visiting un head kofi annan to remove illegal outposts but did not give a timetable the road map peace plan calls for removal of only those outposts erected since sharon came to office the report however states many outposts installed before that time are illegal under israeli law palestinian officials reacted angrily to the report it is time for the international community to say enough to israel and work with the same determination as on other matters said palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei a us embassy spokesman in tel aviv also repeated washington s longstanding call for israel to remove the outposts external

two zero zero six forward online arab israeli conflict history of israel israeli settlements irrealism is a philosophical term which seems to have been coined in the one nine eight zero s by nelson goodman to refer to the belief that the debate between realism and anti realism was based on poor assumptions in practice many irrealists were sympathetic to the critique on realism but were also critical of the idealist relativist or reductionist tendencies of the anti realists artist painter and philospher tristan tondino one nine six one claimed to be an irrealist and held the view that all realities are creations deriving from the needs and desires of living beings as such irrealism is anti egocentric basing truth on sustainability of worlds following goodman tondino claimed truths about the way the world is make up building blocks for world versions world versions may be thought of as functional and work by holding truths while nonetheless contradicting each other tondino attempted to make his audience aware of the irreality of individual human perspectives some of his more well known works include the rule of the two and un tableau que personne ne veut or realism is fascism tondino claimed all art is an expression of irrealism and that the history of art is a representation of world versions irrealism therefore subsumes artistic expression and explains versions like surrealism abstract expressionism realism dadaism etc as types of games all significant ways of worldmaking or world picturing according to tondino irrealism focuses on the deserts surrounding the tiny oases of truth about the world ireealist s accept stace s arguments in his refutation of realism but claim it is just as coherent to infer there is a world as it is tondino s irrealism holds that for the most part it is impossible to know the given in sufficient detail i e sufficient enough to justify a theory like realism but capable of justifying one like irrealism irrealism further adopts the stance that contradiction is acceptable within the following parameters we can t make absolute claims about what really exists and as a result contradictory world pictures can be held coherently for example physicalist monism is preferable in physics while dualism works best in psychology quarks are useless in poems at present love is as real as are molecules despite the fact that certain molecules are emotions love itself is still relevant one of tondino s more salient letrist artworks depicting the statue of liberty is entitled a word that denotes the difference between our

economics course material examples featuring a farmer in a moneyless society using his cattle and produce to trade with his neighbors the examples ran along the lines of you have two cows you want chickens you set out to find another farmer who has chickens and wants a cow they were meant to show the limitations of the barter system leading to the eventual introduction of currency and money the two cows parodies however place the cow owner in a fully fledged economic system where cows are used as a metaphor for all currency capital means of production and economic property the intent is often to point out flaws and absurdities in those systems cows and economic systems the first two cows jokes were meant to compare opposing economic systems such as capitalism and communism typically by describing how government and bureaucracy would interfere with one s quiet enjoyment of one s cows the jokes evolved into satire of various political cultural social and philosophical systems and

necessarily scientific of how different cultures can express different visions of the same political concept by paradox hyperbole or sarcasm in practice most such jokes reflect the views of outsiders to the systems being satirised in the spirit of finding international common ground some also see them as humorous manifestations of an underlying general scheme of political science that would

considered to be a memetic virus a simple example i m a signature virus please add me to your signature and help me spread it is possible for such a virus to carry a short informational payload in addition to the copying instructions in the above example the only payload is the concept and term signature virus signature viruses are usually copied mostly due to the humour humor value of the concept honor system virus an honor system virus claims to be an email virus but using human rather than computer action as the substrate for its destructive and reproductive behaviours it spreads as a simple textual email message with text such as this virus works on the honor system please forward this message to everyone you know then delete all the files on your hard disk thank you for your cooperation it is a joke not a serious virus because its alleged destructive behaviour requires positive action by its intended human victim the intended victim can simply not take the instructed action deleting their own files those humans who follow the virus s instruction to forward it to others can be safely presumed to have not followed the destructive part of the instructions and to be forwarding the message deliberately so that their friends may also appreciate the joke the joke is based on the perceived foolishness in the design of mail programs that are susceptible to viruses a normal email virus works by including computer instructions in an email the mail programs in question predominantly ones developed by microsoft execute those instructions without an explicit request from the user most mail programs in contrast maintain a distinction between code and data and so are immune to this type of virus the honor system virus draws a parallel between humans and mail programs and so makes the reader think about the human behaviours that are analogous to these mail program behaviours it should be noted that some serious email viruses make use of human action in their transmission they include text that attempts to con the user into invoking the machine executable part of the message this is unlike the honor system virus not only because there is a directly machine executable component but also because the virus attempts to mislead the human the honor system virus is entirely straightforward and honest in its human directed instructions just like the computer directed part of a normal email virus variants the honor system virus is also known as the amish computer virus the irish computer virus and the unix computer virus the unix computer virus name refers to the unix family of operating systems in addition to having mail programs that lack the deficiencies that allow viruses to spread by email they make a relatively inhospitable environment

general disciplines such as terminology and symbols electromagnetic compatibility measurement and performance dependability design and development safety and the environment today the iec tends to be

for example iec two six eight one zero one nine seven eight is commonly quoted as the standard defining programme level meters though the content is essentially the same as was defined in british standard bs four two nine seven one nine six eight which in turn came out of work done at the bbc research department the iec was instrumental in developing and distributing standards for units of measurement particularly the gauss hertz and weber they also first proposed a system of standards the giorgi system which ultimately became the si or syst me international d unit s in english the international system of units in one nine three eight it published a multilingual international vocabulary to unify electrical terminology this effort continues and the international electrotechnical vocabulary remains an important work in the electrical and electronic industries iec standards have numbers in the range six zero zero zero zero seven nine nine nine nine and their titles take a form

international organization for standardization iso defines a file system for cd rom media it aims at supporting different computer operating systems such as microsoft windows mac os and systems that follow the unix specification so that data may be exchanged dvds may also use the iso nine six six zero file system however the udf file system is far more commonly used on dvds history a cd rom may be mastered with any kind of information on it sun microsystems for example uses the berkeley unix ufs file systems on many cd roms silicon graphics irix uses efs mac os uses hfs this makes them usable only on this equipment which is no big deal for a bootable cd rom with an operating system on it but for distributing general information it s a big limitation however because cd roms are especially suited to volume publishing of information a standard file system useful across many kinds of architecture is very desirable before there was a standard on this matter some were using the high sierra format on cd rom which arranged file information in a dense sequential layout to minimise nonsequential access the high sierra file system format uses a hierarchical eight levels of directories deep tree file system arrangement similar to unix and ms dos high sierra has a minimal set of file attributes directory or ordinary file and time of recording and name attributes name extension and version the designers realised they could never get people to agree on a unified definition of file attributes so the minimum common information was encoded and a place for future optional extensions system use area was defined for each file high sierra was soon adapted with changes as an international standard iso nine six six zero one nine eight eight and the iso nine six six

organized in both frames and sectors a cd rom sector contains nine eight frames and holds two three five two bytes cd rom mode one usually used for computer data divides the two three five two byte data area defined by the red book standards into one two bytes of synchronisation four bytes of header two zero four eight bytes of user data and two eight eight bytes of error correction and detection codes cd rom mode two usually used for audio video data divides the two three five two byte into one two bytes of synchronisation four bytes of header and two three three six bytes of user data the main advantage of mode two is that it provides an additional one four per cent of the user data space per sector the reason is that mode two does not have the additional edc and ecc error correction data of mode one iso nine six six zero specifications a reserved field at the beginning of the disk is present for use in booting cd rom on a computer system area as a matter of fact its use was not specified by the iso nine six six zero standard but generally it is used for boot information immediately afterwards a series of volume descriptors details the contents and kind of information contained on the disk something like the partition table of ms dos a volume descriptor describes the characteristics of the file system information present on a given cd rom or volume it is divided into two parts the type of volume descriptor and the characteristics of the descriptor the volume descriptor is constructed in this manner so that if a program reading the disk does not understand a particular descriptor it can just skip over it until it finds one it recognises thus allowing the use of many different types of information on one cd rom also if an error were to render a descriptor unreadable a subsequent redundant copy of a descriptor could then allow for fault recovery when checking cd roms with a dump utility we find each descriptor back in a single logical sector on itself and also a backup of the descriptor a few logical sectors further the minimum requirement is that it has a primary descriptor describing the iso nine six six zero file system and an ending descriptor a variable length table that contains information on how many other descriptors are present the iso nine six six zero primary volume descriptor acts much like the superblock of the unix file system providing details on the iso nine six six zero compliant portion of the disk contained within the primary volume descriptor is the root directory record describing the location of the contiguous root directory as in unix directories appear as files for the operating system special use directory entries are successively stored within this region evaluation of the iso nine six six zero filenames is begun at this location the root directory is stored as an extent or sequential series of sectors that contains each of the directory entries appearing in the root in addition since iso nine six six zero works by segmenting the cd rom into logical blocks the size of these blocks is found in the primary volume descriptor as well a cd rom is only compliant to the iso nine six six zero file system standard if there is a primary descriptor and when there is an ending descriptor available e g the volume descriptor constitute a variable length table which contains information on how many other descriptors are present the first field in a volume descriptor is the volume descriptor type type which can have the following values number zero shall mean that the volume descriptor is a boot record number one shall mean that the volume descriptor is a primary volume descriptor number two shall mean that the volume descriptor is a supplementary volume descriptor number three shall mean that the volume descriptor is a volume partition descriptor number two five five shall mean that the volume descriptor is a volume descriptor set terminator the second field is called the standard identifier and is set to cd zero zero one for a cd rom compliant to the iso nine six six zero standard another interesting field is the volume space size which contains the amount of data available on the cd rom file attributes are very simple in iso nine six six zero the most important file attribute is determining whether the file is a directory or an ordinary file file attributes for the file described by the directory entry are stored in the directory entry and optionally in the extended attribute record there are two ways to locate a file on an iso nine six six zero file system one way is to successively interpret the directory names and look through each directory file structure to find the file much the way ms dos and unix work to find a file the other way is through the use of a precompiled table of paths where all the entries are enumerated in the successive contents of a file with the corresponding entries some systems do not have a mechanism for wandering through directories they obtain a match by consulting the table while a large linear table seems a bit arcane it can be of great value as you can quickly search without wandering across the disk thus reducing seek time levels and restrictions there are different levels to this standard level one file names are restricted to eight characters with a three character extension upper case letters numbers and underscore maximum depth of directories is eight level two file names may be up to three one characters level three files allowed to be fragmented mainly to allow packet writing or incremental cd recording all levels restrict names to upper case letters digits and underscores some cd authoring applications allow the user to use almost any ascii character while this does not strictly conform to the iso nine six six zero standard most operating systems that can read iso nine six six zero file systems support the use of most ascii characters as an extension the restrictions on filename length and directory depth have been seen by many as a more serious limitation of the file system many cd authoring applications attempt to work around this by truncating filenames automatically but at the risk of breaking applications that rely on a specific file structure iso nine six six zero one nine nine nine iso nine six six zero one nine nine nine is the latest update to the iso nine six six zero standard it improves on various restrictions imposed by the old standard such as extending the maximum path length to two zero seven characters removing the eight level maximum directory nesting limit and removing the special meaning of the dot character in filenames this has not seen general adoption in operating systems until around two zero zero four but developers are generally starting to catch onto the standard disc images iso nine six six zero file system images iso images are a common way to electronically transfer the contents of cd roms they often have the filename extension iso and are commonly referred to as isos it should be noted an iso file may be a single iso nine six six zero file system image a multi track disc image with a table of contents extensions there are common extensions to iso nine six six zero to deal with the limitations rock ridge supports the preservation of unix linux permissions and longer ascii coded names

standards outdoor ice skating in austria ice skating is traveling on ice with skates narrow and sometimes parabolic blade like devices moulded into special boots or more primitively without boots tied to regular footwear it is mainly done for recreation and as a sport it is possible on canals and lakes etc after it has been freezing for some time and at indoor and outdoor skating tracks and areas with artificial cooling the skating rink regarded as the world s longest about eight kilometres long is the rideau canal located in ottawa ontario canada in some countries with a temperate climate e g the netherlands frozen canals and lakes are fairly rare but skating is popular where these are encountered history ice skating has been believed to be started in sweden over twelve hundred years ago by the vikings the runners made of bones were ground down until they formed a flat gliding surface and thongs tied them to the feet the blades were polished oxen or reindeer bones these weren t very efficient so they used a long stick to push themselves forward and stay upright skates were originally used for transportation over the frozen rivers and later used for fun skating has been found to date back to five zero b c it was most common to skate where there are long cold winters especially in places like scandinavia the skater one seven eight two a portrait of william grant by gilbert stuart in the one seven th century canal racing on wooden skates with iron blades was popular in the netherlands also in that century james the younger son of the british monarch charles i came to the netherlands in exile he fell for the sport when he went back to england this new sport was introduced to the british aristocracy in the one eight th century ice skating became a world known sport and the dutch created skates with much longer blades how it works ice skating works because the metal blade at the bottom of the ice skate shoe can glide with very little friction over the surface of the ice however slightly leaning the blade over and digging one of its edges into the ice rockover and bite gives skaters the ability to increase friction and control their movement at will in addition by choosing to move along curved paths whilst leaning their bodies radially and flexing their knees skaters can use gravity to control and increase their momentum they can also create momentum by pushing the blade against the curved track which it cuts into the ice skillfully combining these two actions of leaning and pushing a technique known as drawing results in what looks like effortless and graceful curvilinear flow across the ice research in materials has come up with a number of theories explaining the true nature of skating the issue is that the precise mechanism by which the low friction is generated is not fully understood though a number of plausible theories abound usually involving explanations of air ice boundary layer water and or friction generated through the skate bottom the boundary layer of water being the cause of slipperiness has been disputed when measurements of the boundary layer water with an atomic force microscope finding the boundary layer to be too thin to supply sufficient friction reduction nevertheless a popular theory of this is because the molecular structure of ice is a crystalline structure it turns out that having this structure abruptly stop when it reaches the top of the ice is not the most entropically favorable form instead there is always a thin film of liquid water ranging in thickness from only a few molecules to thousands of molecules on top of the ice this allows a smoother transition from the structured ice to the completely random structure of the air molecules the thickness of this liquid layer depends almost entirely on the temperature of the surface of the ice higher temperatures give a thicker layer and the liquid layer disappears around two zero c four f however skating is still possible at temperatures much lower than two zero c experiments show that ice has a minimum of kinetic friction at seven c one nine f and many indoor skating rinks set their system to a similar temperature external links

integrated circuit showing memory blocks logic and input output pads around the periphery a monolithic integrated circuit ic or often referred to as a microchip or simply chip is a miniaturized electronic circuit consisting mainly of semiconductor devices as well as passive components which has been manufactured in the surface of a thin substrate of semiconductor material a hybrid integrated circuit is a miniaturized electronic circuit constructed of individual semiconductor devices as well as passive components bonded to a substrate or circuit board this article is about monolithic integrated circuits introduction the integrated circuit was made possible by experimental discoveries which showed that semiconductor devices could perform the functions of vacuum tubes and by mid two zero th century technology advancements in semiconductor device fabrication the integration of large numbers of tiny transistors onto a small chip was an enormous improvement over the manual assembly of vacuum tubes and circuits using discrete components the integrated circuit s mass production capability reliability and ease of adding complexity prompted the use of standardized ics in place of designs using discrete transistors which quickly pushed vacuum tubes into obsolescence there are two main advantages of ics over discrete circuits cost and performance the cost is low because the chips with all their components are printed as a unit by photolithography and not constructed a transistor at a time as of two zero zero six chip areas range from a few square mm to around two five zero mm two with up to one million transistors per mm two advances in integrated circuits among the most advanced integrated circuits are the microprocessors which control everything from computers to cellular phones to digital microwave ovens digital memory chips are another family of integrated circuit that is crucially important to the modern information society while cost of designing and developing a complex integrated circuit is quite high when spread across typically millions of production units the individual ic cost is minimized the performance of ics is high because the small size allows short traces which in turn allows low power logic such as cmos to be used at fast switching speeds ics have consistently migrated to smaller feature sizes over the years allowing more circuitry to be packed on each chip see moore s law as the feature size shrinks almost everything improves the cost and the power consumption go down and the speed goes up since these gains are apparent to the end user there is fierce competition among the manufacturers to use finer geometries this process and the expected progress over the next few years is well described by the international technology roadmap for semiconductors or itrs popularity of ics only a half century after their development was initiated integrated circuits have become ubiquitous computers cellular phones and other digital appliances are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies that is modern computing communications manufacturing and transport systems including the internet all depend on the existence of integrated circuits indeed many scholars believe that the digital revolution brought about by integrated circuits was one of the most significant occurrences in the history of mankind classification and complexity a cmos four zero zero zero ic integrated circuits can be classified into analog digital and mixed signal both analog and digital on the same chip digital integrated circuits can contain anything from one to millions of logic gates flip flops multiplexers and other circuits in a few square millimeters the small size of these circuits allows high speed low power dissipation and reduced manufacturing cost compared with board level integration analog integrated circuits perform analog functions like amplification active filtering demodulation mixing etc adcs and dacs are the key elements of mixed signal ics they convert signals between analog and digital formats analog ics ease the burden on circuit designers by having expertly designed analog circuits available instead of designing a difficult analog circuit from scratch the growth of complexity of integrated circuits follows a trend called moore s law first observed by gordon moore of intel moore s law in its modern interpretation states that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles every two years by the year two zero zero zero the largest integrated circuits contained hundreds of millions of transistors it is difficult to say whether the trend will continue see technological singularity manufacture fabrication main article semiconductor fabrication the semiconductors of the periodic table of the chemical elements were identified as the most likely materials for a solid state vacuum tube by researchers like william shockley at bell laboratories starting in the one nine three zero s starting with copper oxide proceeding to germanium then silicon the materials were systematically studied in the one nine four zero s and one nine five zero s today silicon monocrystals are the main substrate used for integrated circuits ics although some iii v compounds of the periodic table such as gallium arsenide are used for specialised applications like leds lasers and the highest speed integrated circuits it took decades to perfect methods of creating crystals without defects in the crystalline structure of the semiconducting material semiconductor ics are fabricated in a layer process which includes these key process steps imaging deposition etching the main process steps are supplemented by doping cleaning and planarisation steps mono crystal silicon wafers or for special applications silicon on sapphire or gallium arsenide wafers are used as the substrate photolithography is used to mark different areas of the substrate to be doped or to have polysilicon insulators or metal typically aluminium tracks deposited on them criss crossing geometry of the layers of an ic for a cmos process for example a transistor is formed by the criss crossing intersection of striped layers the stripes can be monocrystalline substrate doped layers perhaps insulator layers or polysilicon layers some etched vias to the doped layers might interconnect layers with metal conducting tracks the criss crossed checkerboard like see image above transistors are the most common part of the circuit each checker forming a transistor resistive structures meandering stripes of varying lengths form the loads on the circuit the ratio of the length of the resistive structure to its width combined with its sheet resistivity determines the resistance capacitive structures in form very much like the parallel conducting plates of a traditional electrical capacitor are formed according to the area of the plates with insulating material between the plates owing to limitations in size only very small capacitances can be created on an ic more rarely inductive structures can be simulated by gyrators since a cmos device only draws current on the transition between logic states cmos devices consume much less current than bipolar devices a memory device is the most regular type of integrated circuit the highest density devices are thus memories but even a microprocessor will have memory on the chip see the regular array structure at the bottom of the first image although the structures are intricate with widths which have been shrinking for decades the layers remain much thinner than the device widths the layers of material are fabricated much like a photographic process although light waves in the visible spectrum cannot be used to expose a layer of material as they would be too large for the features thus photons of higher frequencies typically ultraviolet are used to create the patterns for each layer because each feature is so small electron microscopes are essential tools for a process engineer who might be debugging a fabrication process each device is tested before packaging the wafer is then cut into small rectangles called die each die is then connected into a package using aluminium or occasionally gold wires which are welded to pads usually found around the edge of the die after packaging the devices go through final test on very expensive automated testers which can account for over two five percent of the cost of fabrication as of two zero zero five a fabrication facility commonly known as a semiconductor fab costs over a billion us dollars to construct because much of the operation is automated the most advanced processes employ the following techniques the wafers are up to three zero zero mm in diameter wider than a common dinner plate use of nine zero nanometer or smaller chip manufacturing process intel ibm and amd are using nine zero nanometers for their cpu chips and intel has started using a six five nanometer process copper interconnects where copper wiring replaces aluminium for interconnects low k dielectric insulators silicon on insulator soi strained silicon in a process used by ibm known as strained silicon directly on insulator ssdoi packaging the earliest integrated circuits were packaged in ceramic flat packs which continued to be used by the military for their reliability and small size for many years commercial circuit packaging quickly moved to the dual in line package dip first in ceramic and later in plastic in the one nine eight zero s pin counts of vlsi circuits exceeded the practical limit for dip packaging leading to pin grid array pga and leadless chip carrier lcc packages surface mount packaging appeared in the early one nine eight zero s and became popular in the late one nine eight zero s using finer lead pitch with leads formed as either gull wing or j lead as exemplified by small outline integrated circuit a carrier which occupies an area about three zero five zero less than an equivalent dip with a typical thickness that is seven zero less this package has gull wing leads protruding from the two long sides and a lead spacing of zero zero five zero inches small outline integrated circuit soic and plcc packages in the late one nine nine zero s pqfp and tsop packages became the most common for high pin count devices though pga packages are still often used for high end microprocessors ball grid array bga packages have existed since the one nine seven zero s traces out of the die through the package and into the printed circuit board have very different electrical properties compared to on chip signals they require special design techniques and need much more electric power than signals confined to the chip itself when multiple die are put in one package it is called sip for system in package when multiple die are combined on a small substrate often ceramic it s called a mcm or multi chip module the boundary between a big mcm and a small printed circuit board is sometimes fuzzy history origins and generations the birth of the ic the integrated circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist geoffrey w a dummer born one nine zero nine working for the royal radar establishment of the british ministry of defence and published in washington d c on may seven one nine five two dummer unsuccessfully attempted to build such a circuit in one nine five six the first integrated circuits were manufactured independently by two scientists jack kilby of texas instruments filed a patent for a solid circuit made of germanium on february six one nine five nine kilby received patents us three one three eight seven four three us three one three eight seven four seven us three two six one zero eight one and us three four three four zero one five robert noyce of fairchild semiconductor was awarded a patent for a more complex unitary circuit made of silicon on april two five one nine six one see the chip that jack built for more information noyce credited kurt lehovec of sprague electric for the principle of p n junction isolation caused by the action of a biased p n junction the diode as a key concept behind the ic ssi msi lsi the first integrated circuits contained only a few transistors called small scale integration ssi they used circuits containing transistors numbering in the tens ssi circuits were crucial to early aerospace projects and vice versa both the minuteman missile and apollo program needed lightweight digital computers for their inertially guided flight computers the apollo guidance computer led and motivated the integrated circuit technology while the minuteman missile forced it into mass production these programs purchased almost all of the available integrated circuits from one nine six zero through one nine six three and almost alone provided the demand that funded the production improvements to get the production costs from one zero zero zero circuit in one nine six zero dollars to merely two five circuit in one nine six three dollars the next step in the development of integrated circuits taken in the late one nine six zero s introduced devices which contained hundreds of transistors on each chip called medium scale integration msi they were attractive economically because while they cost little more to produce than ssi devices they allowed more complex systems to be produced using smaller circuit boards less assembly work because of fewer separate components and a number of other advantages further development driven by the same economic factors led to large scale integration lsi in the mid one nine seven zero s with tens of thousands of transistors per chip lsi circuits began to be produced in large quantities around one nine seven zero for computer main memories and pocket calculators vlsi the final step in the development process starting in the one nine eight zero s and continuing on was very large scale integration vlsi with hundreds of thousands of transistors and beyond well past several million in the latest stages for the first time it became possible to fabricate a cpu on a single integrated circuit to create a microprocessor in one nine eight six the first one megabit ram chips were introduced which contained more than one million transistors microprocessor chips produced in one nine nine four contained more than three million transistors this step was largely made possible by the codification of design rules for the cmos technology used in vlsi chips which made production of working devices much more of a systematic endeavour see the one nine eight zero landmark text by carver mead and lynn conway referenced below ulsi wsi soc to reflect further growth of the complexity the term ulsi that stands for ultra large scale integration was proposed for chips of complexity more than one million of transistors however there is no qualitative leap between vlsi and ulsi hence normally in technical texts the vlsi term covers ulsi as well and ulsi is reserved only for cases when it is necessary to emphasize the chip complexity e g in marketing the most extreme integration technique is wafer scale integration wsi which uses whole uncut wafers containing entire computers processors as well as memory attempts to take this step commercially in the one nine eight zero s e g by gene amdahl failed mostly because of defect free manufacturability problems and it does not now seem to be a high priority for industry the wsi technique failed commercially but advances in semiconductor manufacturing allowed for another attack on the ic complexity known as system on chip soc design in this approach components traditionally manufactured as separate chips to be wired together on a printed circuit board are designed to occupy a single chip that contains memory microprocessor s peripheral interfaces input output logic control data converters and other components together composing the whole electronic system other developments in the one nine eight zero s programmable integrated circuits were developed these devices contain circuits whose logical function and connectivity can be programmed by the user rather than being fixed by the integrated circuit manufacturer this allows a single chip to be programmed to implement different lsi type functions such as logic gates adders and registers current devices named fpgas field programmable gate arrays can now implement tens of thousands of lsi circuits in parallel and operate up to four zero zero mhz the techniques perfected by the integrated circuits industry over the last three decades have been used to create microscopic machines known as mems these devices are used in a variety

three two seven zero is a class of terminals made by ibm known as display devices normally used to communicate with ibm mainframes the three two seven zero attempts to minimize the number of i o interrupts required by accepting large blocks of data known as datastreams ibm stopped manufacturing terminals and punch cards for that matter many years ago but the ibm three two seven zero protocol is still commonly used via emulation to access some mainframe based applications use of three two seven zero is slowly diminishing over time as more and more mainframe applications acquire web interfaces but in some situations such as call centers the green screen three two seven zero interface is still the most productive and efficient principles in a datastream both text and control or formatting functions are interspersed allowing an entire screen to be painted as a single output operation the concept of formatting in these devices allows the screen to be divided into clusters of contiguous character cells for which numerous attributes colour highlighting character set protection from modification can be set further using a technique known as read modified the changes from any number of formatted fields that have been modified can be read as a single input without transferring any other data another technique to enhance the terminal throughput of the cpu some users familiar with character interrupt driven terminal interfaces find this technique unusual however most web interfaces operate in much the same way and often for the same reasons the three two seven zero has twelve and later twenty four special programmed function keys or pf keys and three pa or program attention keys when one of these keys is pressed it will cause its control unit historically usually an ibm three two seven four or three one seven four but nowadays the onboard mainframe equivalent to generate an i o interrupt and present a special code identifying which key was pressed application program functions such as termination page up page down or help can be invoked by a single key push thereby reducing the load on very busy processors in this way the cpu is not bothered at every keystroke a scheme which allowed an early three zero three three mainframe with only one six mb to support up to one seven five zero zero three two seven zero terminals under cics on the other hand vi like behaviour was not possible but end user responsiveness was arguably more predictable with three two seven zero something users appreciated for the same reason a porting of lotus one two three to mainframes with three two seven nine screens did not meet success because its programmers were not able to properly adapt the spreadsheet s user interface to a screen at a time rather than character at a time device in contrast ibm s officevision office productivity software enjoyed great success with three two seven zero interaction because of its design understanding and for many years the profs calendar was the most commonly displayed screen on office terminals around the world as mentioned above the web and http is more similar to three two seven zero interaction because the terminal browser is given more responsibility for managing presentation and user input minimizing host interaction while still facilitating server based information retrieval and processing in fact not too

etc prior to the introduction of plastics it was used for billiard balls piano keys buttons and ornamental items the word ivory was traditionally applied to the tusks of elephants plastics have been viewed by piano purists as an inferior ivory substitute on piano keys although other recently developed materials more closely resemble the feel of real ivory structure the chemical structure of the teeth and tusks of mammals is the same regardless of the species of origin and the trade in certain teeth and tusks other than elephant is well established and widespread therefore ivory can correctly be used to describe any mammalian teeth or tusks of commercial interest which is large enough to be carved or scrimshawed teeth and tusks pacific walrus at cape peirce teeth and tusks have the same origins teeth are specialized structures adapted for food mastication tusks which are extremely large teeth projecting beyond the lips have evolved from teeth and give certain species an evolutionary advantage the teeth of most mammals consists of a root and the tusk proper teeth and tusks have the same physical structures pulp cavity dentine cementum and enamel the innermost area is the pulp cavity the pulp cavity is an empty space within the tooth that conforms to the shape of the pulp odontoblasts line the pulp cavity and are responsible for the production of dentine dentine which is the main component of carved ivory objects forms a layer of consistent thickness around the pulp cavity and comprises the bulk of the tooth and tusk dentine is a mineralized connective tissue with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins the inorganic component of dentine consists of dahllite dentine contains a microscopic structure called dentinal tubules which are micro canals that radiate outward through the dentine from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum border these canals have different configurations in different ivories and their diameter ranges between zero eight and two two micrometres their length is dictated by the radius of the tusk the three dimensional configuration of the dentinal tubules is under genetic control and is therefore a characteristic unique to the order ivory art in the ancient world paleolithic cro magnon man during the late stages of the ice age were the first to carve in ivory mammoth tusks both the greek and roman civilizations used large quantities of ivory to make high value works of art precious religious objects and decorative boxes for costly objects ivory was often used to form the whites of the eyes of statues the north african elephant population was probably reduced to extinction due to the demand for ivory in the classical world ivory has been a most prestigious material for carving tooth and tusk ivory can be carved into an almost infinite variety of shapes and objects a small example of modern carved ivory objects are small statuary netsukes jewelry flatware handles furniture inlays and piano keys additionally warthog tusks and teeth from sperm whales orcas and hippos can also be scrimshawed or superficially carved thus retaining their morphologically recognizable shapes availablity due to the rapid decline in the populations of the animals that produce it the importation and sale of ivory in many countries is banned or severely restricted much of the decline in population is due to poachers during and before the one nine eight zero s since the worldwide ivory trade ban in one nine eight nine there have been ups and downs in elephant populations and ivory trade as bans have been placed and lifted many african countries including zimbabwe and south africa claim that ivory trade is necessary both to stimulate their economies and reduce elephant populations which are allegedly harming the environment in two zero zero two the united nations partially lifted the ban on ivory trade allowing a few countries to export certain amounts of ivory yet a one nine nine nine study done by oxford university found that less than one percent of the five hundred million us dollars ivory sales generate ever reach africans most of it goes to middlemen and vendors so the effectiveness of the policy is in question kenya which saw its elephant populations plummet in the decade preceding the one nine eight nine ban claims that legalizing ivory trade anywhere in africa will endanger elephants everywhere in africa as poachers would attempt to launder their illegal ivory with legal stockpiles trade in the ivory from the tusks of dead mammoths has occurred for three zero zero years and continues to be legal mammoth ivory is used today to make handcrafted knives and similar implements a species of hard nut is gaining popularity as a replacement for ivory although its size limits its

one mac os instant messengers windows instant messengers instant messaging paintings by monet impressionism was a one nine th century art movement that began as a loose association of paris based artists who began publicly exhibiting their art in the one eight six zero s the name of the movement is derived from claude monet s impression sunrise impression soleil levant critic louis leroy inadvertently coined the term in a satiric review published in le charivari the influence of impressionist thought spread beyond the art world leading to impressionist music and impressionist literature characteristics of impressionist painting include visible brushstrokes light colors open composition emphasis on light in its changing qualities often accentuating the effects of the passage of time ordinary subject matter and unusual visual angles impressionism also describes art done in this style but outside of the late one nine th century time period overview radicals in their time early impressionists broke the picture making rules of academic painting they began by painting driven by colours rather than by line drawing from the work of painters such as eugene delacroix they also began from unique working methods such as painting outside of the studio for subjects such as the still life and portrait the techniques of impressionism gradually grew more specific to the movement and encompassed what its adherents argued was a different way of seeing they painted en plein air outdoors rather than in a studio as was the custom capturing the momentary and transient aspects of sunlight by the last years of the one nine th century the public came to believe that these artists had captured a fresh and original vision that was highly skilled even if it did not meet with approval of the artistic establishment the impressionists looked to beauty in candid poses and compositions in the play of light and in a bright and varied use of colour impressionist paintings feature short broken brush strokes of pure untinted and unmixed colour compositions are simplified and innovative and the emphasis is on overall effect rather than upon details the brushstrokes increasingly became visible and part of the composition as opposed to the then current technique of having an almost smooth surface of the canvas without visible brush strokes impressionism rose at the same time that other painters were also exploring methods of painting that moved away from the subjects forms and norms that dominated the art market at that time for example edvard munch by placing the center of artistic creation as the eye that views the subject rather than the subject and by creating a welter of techniques and forms impressionism became seminal to various movements in painting which would come after including post impressionism fauvism cubism and individual painters that were not part of an exact school such as paul gauguin vincent van gogh and paul cezanne paintings by renoir beginnings in an atmosphere of change as emperor napoleon iii rebuilt paris and waged war the acad mie des beaux arts dominated the french art scene in the middle of the one nine th century art at the time was considered a conservative enterprise whose innovations fell within the acad mie s defined borders the acad mie set the standards for french painting in addition to dictating the content of paintings historical subjects religious themes and portraits were valued the acad mie commanded which techniques artists used they valued somber conservative colours refined images mirroring reality when closely examined were esteemed the acad mie encouraged artists to eliminate all traces of brush strokes essentially isolating art from the artist s personality emotions and working techniques the acad mie held an annual art show salon de paris and artists whose work displayed in the show won prizes and garnered commissions to create more art only art selected by the acad mie jury was exhibited in the show the standards of the juries about suitable art for the salon reflected the values of the acad mie the young artists painted in a lighter and brighter style than most of the generation before them extending the realism style of gustave courbet winslow homer and the barbizon school they submitted their art to the salon and the juries rejected the pieces a core group of them claude monet pierre auguste renoir and alfred sisley studied under charles gleyre the three of them became friends and often painted together in one eight six three the jury rejected the luncheon on the grass le d jeuner sur l herbe by douard manet primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men on a picnic according to the jury nudes were acceptable in historical and allegorical paintings but to show them in common settings was forbidden manet felt humiliated by the sharply worded rejection of the jury which set off a firestorm among many french artists although manet did not consider himself an impressionist he led discussions at caf guerbois where the impressionists gathered and influenced the explorations of the artistic group after seeing the rejected works in one eight six three emperor napoleon iii decreed that the public be allowed to judge the work themselves and the salon des refus s salon of the refused was organized for years art critics rebuked the salon des refus s and in one eight seven four the impressionists though not yet known by the name organized their own exhibition after seeing the show critic louis leroy an engraver painter and successful playwright wrote a scathing review in the le charivari newspaper targeting a painting by a then obscure artist he titled his article the exhibition of the impressionists leroy declared that impression sunrise impression soleil levant by claude monet was at most a sketch and could hardly be termed a finished work leroy wrote in the form of a dialog between viewers impression

finished than that seascape the term impressionists gained favor with the artists not as a term of derision but as a badge of honor the techniques and standards within the movement varied but the spirit of rebellion and independence bound the movement together impressionist techniques short thick strokes of paint in a sketchy way allowing the painter to capture and emphasize the essence of the subject rather than its details they left brush strokes on the canvas adding a new dimension of familiarity with the personality of the artist for the viewer to enjoy colors with as little pigment mixing as possible allowing the eye of the viewer to optically mix the colors as they looked at the canvas and providing a vibrant experience for the viewer impressionists did not shade mix with black their colours in order to obtain darker pigments instead when the artists needed darker shades they mixed with complementary colours black was used but only as a colour in its own right they painted wet paint into the wet paint instead of waiting for successive applications to dry producing softer edges and intermingling of color impressionist avoided the use of thin paints to create glazes which earlier artists built up carefully to produce effects rather the impressionists put paint down thickly and did not rely upon layering impressionists discovered or emphasized aspects of the play of natural light including an acute awareness of how colours reflect from object to object in outdoor paintings they boldly painted shadows with the blue of the sky as it reflected onto surfaces giving a sense of freshness and openness that was not captured in painting previously blue shadows on snow inspired the technique they worked en plein air outdoors previous artists occasionally used these techniques but impressionists employed them constantly earlier examples are found in the works of frans hals peter paul rubens john constable theodore rousseau gustave courbet camille corot eugene boudin and eug ne delacroix impressionists took advantage of the mid century introduction of premixed paints in tubes resembling modern toothpaste tubes which allowed artists to work more spontaneously both outdoors and indoors previously each painter made his or her own paints by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil content and composition even though historically painting was viewed as primarily a way to depict historical and religious subjects in a rather formal manner painters portrayed everyday subjects many one seven th century dutch painters like jan steen focused on common subjects but their works showed the influences of traditional composition in arrangement of the scene when impressionism began there was interest among the artists in mundane subject matter and a new method of capturing images became available photography was gaining popularity and as cameras became more portable photographs became more candid photography inspired impressionists to capture the moment not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape but in the day to day lives of people photography and popular japanese art prints japonism combined to introduce to

detailed usages see list of internet slang internet slang is slang which internet users have coined and promulgated such terms typically originated with the purpose of saving keystrokes many use the same abbreviations in text messages the terms often appear in lower case with capitals often reserved for emphasis the pronoun i for example often appears simply as i to avoid misapprehension and clarify the author s intent netizens may use emoticons emoticons or smilies such as may be used both genuinely and sarcastically for example the p emoticon can express either genuine amusement and a sense of fun or a negative sarcastic comment on something deciphering and understanding what was written per se versus the author s intent is part of the internet s attraction and enjoyment like most jargon internet slang aggrandizes author and reader causing them to appear as having specialized knowledge of an already complex medium internet slang perhaps has a higher learning curve than face to face slang as face to face slang can often be deciphered from the context of the facial expressions body language and tone of voice origins the vocabulary of internet slang draws from many different sources typically environments that placed value on brevity of communication some terms such as fubar have roots as far back as world war ii other terms come from more recent forms of communication such as tty and irc chat acronyms originally developed on pre internet bulletin board systems a handful for example asap po ed far pre date computers the three letter acronym remains one of the most popular types of abbreviation in computing and telecom terminology and slang similar systems have since come into use with users of text messaging wireless telephones with the rise of instant messaging services icq aol and msn among others the vocabulary has expanded dramatically aside from instant messaging programs another realm full of online languages exists the internet gaming world one of the most popular forms of video game slang has become known as h four x zero r or as one three three seven five p three four k in leetspeak for parents today learning the online language can play an important role in maintaining the online safety of children an article produced by microsoft may help parents begin to understand some of the things their kids say in game many of the more knowledgeable online gamers consider this article unhelpful especially for microsoft s attempts to interpret one three three seven speak note that the many true computer gurus hackers and coders regard leetspeak as a pathetic trademark of a newbie or of a show off gurus hackers and coders almost always use leetspeak sarcastically they label the use of leetspeak excessive use of abbreviations and incorrect spelling and grammar as rude and they usually regard it as indicative of a script kiddie a computer programmer that steals and uses scripts without an understanding of the programming language or someone who is just an idiot in general users sometimes make up internet abbreviations on the spot therefore many of them can seem confusing obscure whimsical or even nonsensical this type of on the spot abbreviating leads to such things as otp on the phone or the less common optd outside petting the dog another feature common to internet communication involves the truncation and morphing of words to forms that users can type more readily examples of this include addy address plural addys pic picture pics pix or piccies for plural proggy computer program prolly probably also probs sig signature also siggy asl age sex location a phrase often used in internet chat rooms the form teh offers a special case of this transformation this originated as a corruption of the and often pops up spontaneously when typing fast so common has it become in fact that it has made the jump to purposeful usage typically it occurs in situations where the writer presents as self consciously enthusiastic mimicking the less grammatical internet newbie that movie was teh suck the fight scene with all the agent smiths was teh awesome etc it occurs most commonly in teh suck teh lame and teh cool jeff k of something awful popularized this sarcastic usage similarly netizens may use the word liek or leik as sarcastic misspellings of the word like as in i liek pie it often implies an insult to one s intelligence and or typing ability liek is also often used as a geeky way of typing the preposition like for example in the phrase and i was liek internet abbreviations evolve and change continually online games provide a good place to observe language variation in use often people uninterested in computer programming do not understand the more classically nerdy phrases like two b two b which means to be or not to be thus such usages become useless or appear only in minority forums from the days of fido mail when many computers ran dos we find meaning grin big grin very big grin and of course very big shit eating grin lower case variants and so on are also used usage notes common disclaimer phrases sometimes called parentheticals also often contract into acronyms they tend to occur at certain points in a sentence which can facilitate decoding this is a fraction of the full list but some of these disclaimers include imho in my humble opinion afaik

go the word newbie occurs almost exclusively to refer to all sorts of new users of an internet forum or starters in a particular field of activity it does not function as a pejorative term per se but can do so when combined with rtfm etc n zero zero b has much more derogatory implications than newbie nub has also been derrived from the word newbie and has negative implications as newbie does although internet slang has a close relationship with leetspeak only online gamers traditionally use leet while much larger groups of internet users commonly use internet slang the symbols words or often enclose a user s facial expression action or other feeling that is difficult to express via other online methods these are also known as emotes stemming from emotion which is where the word emoticon has its origins as well for instance smile jumping up and down or very very sad right now are all acceptable usages double colons are occasionally seen on each side of such expressions excited this usage may originate from an action syntax common to simming the symbols and are often to denote the author s feelings at the time of writing an enclosed sentence or paragraph and are known as emotags for instance i just love how wonderfully the new nerf to our characters has gone this notation derives from html variants exist such as a syntax variant found on internet forums and

however in english it is often used to refer to a zulu regiment which is called an ibutho in zulu the first impis were formed by zulu king shaka who was then only the exiled illegitimate son of king senzangakona but already showing much prowess as a general in the army of mthethwa king dingiswayo in the mthethwa ndwandwe war in the early one eight one zero s youth impi warriors were raised from the age as low as of six joining the army as udibi porters at first being enrolled into same age groups intanga until they were buta d zulu boys accompanied their fathers and brothers on campaign as servants eventually they would go to the nearest ikhanda to kleza which literally means to drink directly from the udder at which point they would become inkwebane or cadets they would spend their time training until they were formally enlisted by the king they would challenge each other to stick fights which had to be accepted on pain of dishonor enlistment on being formally formed into regiments ibutho plural amabutho after their two zero th birthday they would build their ikhanda often referred to as a homestead and it was basically a stockaded group of huts surrounding a corral for cattle which would be where they would come when mustered for active service they would have to come for this muster until they married which was a privilege the king bestowed they were trained to outrun a horse cover about eight zero km five zero miles a day on foot and hide and stalk in the underbrush the amabutho were recruited on the basis of age rather than regional or tribal origin the reason for this was to enhance the centralised power of the zulu king at the expense of clan and tribal leaders they swore loyalty to the king of the zulu nation every ibutho was a thousand warriors strong and originally contained warriors from the same intanga this practice later changed as casualties suffered by the regiments made reinforcements necessary each ibutho had its own colors in colored shields headdress and other ornaments an impi a force which contained several amabutho was also accompanied by udibi young boys who carried implements like cooking pots and sleeping mats and on occasion acted as scouts shaka insisted that troops wear no shoes they could run faster and were not disabled by the loss of their sandals training for this was to stamp thorns into the ground with bare feet service in wartime the zulu soldier went into battle minimally dressed painting his upper body and face with chalk and red ochre despite the popular conception of elaborately panoplied warriors in shaka s day warriors often wore elaborate plumes and cow tail regalia but by the anglo zulu war of one eight seven nine many warriors wore only loin cloth into battle as a weapon he carried the iklwa stabbing spear losing one could result in execution cudgels knobkerrie he also carried shields which were property of the king the iklwa with its long c two five cm tip was an invention of shaka that superseded the older thrown assegai it could theoretically be used both in melee and as a thrown weapon but warriors were forbidden in shaka s day from throwing it which would disarm them and give their opponents something to throw back moreover shaka felt it discouraged warriors from closing into hand to hand combat however after the zulus encountered the boers and the british who were armed with firearms the zulus re introduced the throwing spear in an effort to counter their enemies firepower by the time of zulu war king cetshwayo also equipped them with muskets and they also used rifles captured from the british however many of their weapons were obsolete or in bad condition and warriors were usually badly trained in their use tactics shaka used impis with a modified encircling tactic impondo zankoma bull s horns impi troops would divide into four groups the main group isifuba chest would face the enemy two wings izimpondo horns on two sides of the enemy and then force them towards the center the fourth party usually the veterans remained as a reserve they travelled light and carried their own food or foraged along the way the image of the zulu warrior who could run fifty miles and fight a battle at the end of it is not at all true but the barefooted zulu warrior was swift and could cover perhaps two five miles a day thus tactics against their enemies other african tribes the boers and the british were surprise and overwhelming force rather than siege or long campaigns during the anglo zulu war british commander lord chelmsford complained that they did not fight fair history against the ndwandwe numerically superior northern neighbours who invaded zulu territory to suppress them shaka played hide and seek games while laying waste to the land to prevent foraging shaka waited and only attacked when the ndwandwe were divided or exhausted impi were also famous for their custom washing of spears in their enemy s blood in which they cut open the belly of killed and allegedly sometimes still living opponents the zulus believed that this meant the release of the opponent s spirit so it could not haunt the killer complex ceremonies surrounded battles and great honours were bestowed upon the courageous in battle cowards were dishonoured and occasionally executed wounds were crudely serviced but the zulus had an unusual rate of recovery overall the zulu army was versatile and all but invincible against other african armies however they faced tougher opposition when confronted with the boers from around one eight three zero and later the british although zulu impis under dingane had some early success against the trek boers they suffered a bloody defeat when attacking a fortified laager at the battle of blood river in one eight three eight similarly the zulus scored a famous victory over the british at the battle of isandlwana in one eight seven nine but ultimately were no match for the martini henry rifles and gatling machine guns used against them in by the british troops they suffered successive defeats at the battle of kambula battle of gingindlovu and the battle of ulundi which led to the

survive the conversion to christianity but much of it was preserved shorn of its religious meanings in medieval irish literature which represents the most extensive and best preserved of all the branches of celtic mythology although many of the manuscripts have failed to survive and much more material was probably never committed to writing there is enough remaining to enable the identification of four distinct if overlapping cycles the mythological cycle the ulster cycle the fenian cycle and the historical cycle there are also a number of extant mythological texts that do not fit into any of the cycles in addition there are a large number of recorded folk tales that while not strictly mythological feature personages from one or more of these four cycles the sources the three main manuscript sources for irish mythology are the late one one th early one two th century lebor na huidre which is in the library of the royal irish academy the early one two th century book of leinster in the library of trinity college dublin and the rawlinson manuscript b five zero two rawl housed in the bodleian library at oxford university despite the dates of these sources most of the material they contain predates their composition the earliest of the prose can be dated on linguistic grounds to the eight th century and some of the verse may be as old as the six th century other important sources include a group of four manuscripts originating in the west of ireland in the late one four th or early one five th century the yellow book of lecan the great book of lecan the book of hy many and the book of ballymote the first of these contains part of the earliest known version of the t in b c ailnge and is housed in trinity college the other three are in the royal academy other one five th century manuscripts such as the book of fermoy also contain interesting materials as do such later syncretic works such as geoffrey keating s foras feasa ar irinn the history of ireland ca one six four zero particularly as these later compilers and writers may have had access to manuscript sources that have since disappeared when using these sources it is as always important to question the impact of the circumstances in which they were produced most of the manuscripts were created by christian monks who may well have been torn between the desire to record their native culture and their religious hostility to pagan beliefs resulting in some of the gods being many of the later sources may also have formed part of a propaganda effort designed to create a history for the people of ireland that could bear comparison with the mythological descent of their british invaders from the founders of rome that was promulgated by geoffrey of monmouth and others there was also a tendency to rework irish genealogies to fit into the known schema of greek or biblical genealogy it was once unquestioned that medieval irish literature preserved truly ancient traditions in a form virtually unchanged through centuries of oral tradition back to the ancient celts of europe kenneth jackson famously described the ulster cycle as a window on the iron age and garret olmsted has attempted to draw parallels between t in b cuailnge the ulster cycle epic and the iconography of the gundestrup cauldron however this nativist position has been challenged by revisionist scholars who believe that much of it was created in christian times in deliberate imitation of the epics of classical literature that came with latin learning the revisionists would point to passages apparently influenced by the iliad in t in b cuailnge and the existence of togail troi a very early irish adaptation of the aeneid found in the book of leinster and note that the material culture of the stories is generally closer to the time of the stories composition than to the distant past a consensus has emerged which encourages the critical reading of the material mythological cycle the mythological cycle comprising stories of the former gods and origins of the irish is the least well preserved of the four cycles the most important sources are the metrical dindshenchas or lore of places and the lebor gab la renn or book of invasions other manuscripts preserve such mythological tales as the dream of aengus the wooing of tain and cath maige tuireadh the second battle of magh tuireadh one of the best known of all irish stories oidheadh clainne lir or the tragedy of the children of lir is also part of this cycle lebor gab la renn is a pseudo history of ireland tracing the ancestry of the irish back to noah it tells of a series of invasions or takings of ireland by a succession of peoples one of whom was the people known as the tuatha d danann who were believed to have inhabited the island before the arrival of the gaels or milesians they faced opposition from their enemies the fomorians led by balor of the evil eye balor was eventually slain by lug l mfada lug of the long arm at the second battle of magh tuireadh with the arrival of the gaels the tuatha d danann retired underground to become the fairy people of later myth and legend the metrical dindshenchas is the great onomastic work of early ireland giving the naming legends of significant places in a sequence of poems it includes a lot of important information on mythological cycle figures and stories including the battle of tailtiu in which the tuatha d danann were defeated by the milesians it is important to note that by the middle ages the tuatha d danann were not viewed so much as gods as the shape shifting magician population of an earlier golden age ireland texts such as lebor gab la renn and cath maige tuireadh present them as kings and heroes of the distant past complete with death tales however there is considerable evidence both in the texts and from the wider celtic world that they were once considered deities even after they are displaced as the rulers of ireland characters such as lug the m rr gan aengus and manannan appear in stories set centuries later betraying their immortality a poem in the book of leinster lists many of the tuatha d but ends although the author enumerates them he does not worship them goibniu creidhne and luchta are referred to as tr d e d na three gods of craftsmanship and the dagda s name is interpreted in medieval texts as the good god nuada is cognate with the british god nodens lug is a reflex of the pan celtic deity lugus tuireann may be related to the gaulish taranis ogma to ogmios the badb to catubodua other important tuatha d danann figures boann banba brigid creidhne cyhiraeth danu dian cecht donn riu tain f dla macha nechtan s dhe banshee also spelt bean sidhe ulster cycle the ulster cycle is set around the beginning of the christian era and most of the action takes place in the provinces of ulster and connacht it consists of a group of heroic stories dealing with the lives of conchobar mac nessa king of ulster the great hero c chulainn the son of lug and of their friends lovers and enemies these are the ulaid or people of the north eastern corner of ireland and the action of the stories centres round the royal court at emain macha close to the modern city of armagh the ulaid had close links with the irish colony in scotland and part of c chulainn s training takes place in that colony the cycle consists of stories of the births early lives and training wooings battles feastings and deaths of the heroes and reflects a warrior society in which warfare consists mainly of single combats and wealth is measured mainly in cattle these stories are written mainly in prose the centrepiece of the ulster cycle is the t in b c ailnge other important ulster cycle tales include the tragic death of aife s only son bricriu s feast and the destruction of ua derga s hostel the exile of the sons of usnach better known as the tragedy of deirdre and the source of plays by john millington synge and william butler yeats is also part of this cycle this cycle is in some respects close to the mythological cycle some of the characters from the latter reappear and the same sort of shape shifting magic is much in evidence side by side with a grim almost callous realism while we may suspect a few characters such as medb or c ro of once being deities and c chulainn in particular displays superhuman prowess the characters are firmly mortal and rooted in a specific time and place if the mythological cycle represents a golden age the ulster cycle is ireland s heroic age fenian cycle like the ulster cycle the fenian cycle is concerned with the deeds of irish heroes the stories of the fenian cycle appear to be set around the three rd century and mainly in the provinces of leinster and munster they differ from the other cycles in the strength of their links with the irish speaking community in scotland and there are many extant fenian texts from that country they also differ from the ulster cycle in that the stories are told mainly in verse and that in tone they are nearer to the tradition of romance than the tradition of epic the stories concern the doings of fionn mac cumhail and his band of soldiers the fianna the single most important source for the fenian cycle is the acallamh na sen rach colloquy of the old men which is found in two one five th century manuscripts the book of lismore and laud six one zero as well as a one seven th century manuscript from killiney county dublin the text is dated from linguistic evidence to the one two th century the text records conversations between the last surviving members of the fianna and st patrick and runs to some eight zero zero zero lines the late dates of the manuscripts may reflect a longer oral tradition for the fenian stories the fianna of the story are divided into the clann baiscne led by fionn and the clann morna led by his enemy goll mac morna goll killed fionn s father cumhal in battle and the boy fionn was brought up in secrecy as a youth while being trained in the art of poetry he accidentally burned his thumb while cooking the salmon of knowledge which allowed him to suck or bite his thumb in order to receive bursts of stupendous wisdom he took his place as the leader of his band and numerous tales are told of their adventures two of the greatest irish tales toraigheacht dhiarmada agus ghrainne the pursuit of diarmuid and grainne and oisin in tir na nog form part of the cycle the diarmuid and grainne story which is one of the few fenian prose tales is a probable source of tristan and isolde the world of the fenian cycle is one in which professional warriors spend their time hunting fighting and engaging in adventures in the spirit world new entrants into the band are expected to be knowledgeable in poetry as well as undergo a number of physical tests or ordeals again there is no religious element in these tales unless it is one of hero worship historical cycle it was part of the duty of the medieval irish bards or court poets to record the history of the family and the genealogy of the king they served this they did in poems that blended the mythological and the historical to a greater or lesser degree the resulting stories form what has come to be known as the historical cycle or more correctly cycles as there are a number of independent groupings the kings that are covered range from the almost entirely mythological labraid loingsech who became high king of ireland around four three one bc to the entirely historical brian boru however the greatest glory of the historical cycle is the buile shuibhne the frenzy of suibhne a one two th century tale told in verse and prose suibhne king of dal naraide was cursed by st ronan and became a kind of half man half bird condemned to live out his life in the woods fleeing from his human companions the story has captured the imaginations of contemporary irish poets and has been translated by trevor joyce and seamus heaney other tales adventures the adventures or echtrae are a group of stories of visits to the irish other world the most famous oisin in tir na nog belongs to the fenian cycle but several free standing adventures survive including the adventure of conle the voyage of bran mac ferbail and the adventure of l egaire voyages the voyages or immrama are tales of sea journeys and the wonders seen on them these probably grew from the experiences of fishermen combined with the other world elements that inform the adventures of the seven immrama mentioned in the manuscripts only three survive the voyage of mael duin the voyage of the ui chorra and the voyage of snedgus and mac riagla the voyage of mael duin is the forerunner of the later voyage of st brendan folk tales at the beginning of the one nine th century herminie t kavanagh wrote down many irish folk tales which she published in magazines and in two books twenty six years after her death the tales

insurance in law and economics is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of potential financial loss insurance is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a potential loss from one entity to another in exchange for a premium and duty of care principles of insurance the timing or occurrence of the loss must be uncertain the rate of losses must be relatively predictable in order to set premiums prices insurers must be able to estimate them accurately if the coverage is unique the insured will pay a correspondingly higher premium lloyd s of london often accepts unique coverages e g the insuring of tina turner s legs and jennifer lopez s butt the losses must be predictable on a macro level insurers need to know how much they would be required to pay when the insured for event occurs most types of insurance have maximum levels of payouts but not all do notably health insurance the loss must be significant the legal principle of de minimis dictates that trivial matters are not covered furthermore rational insurance uses existing insurance when the transaction costs dictate that filing a claim is not rational the loss must not be catastrophic if the insurer is insolvent it will be unable to pay the insured in the united states there is a system of guaranty funds run at the state level to reimburse insured people whose insurance companies have become insolvent this program is run by the national association of insurance commissioners naic to avoid catastrophic depletion of their own capital insurers almost universally purchase reinsurance to protect them against excessively large accumulations of risk in a single area and to protect them against large scale catastrophes insurance contract principles a property or liability insurance policy is a personal contract a conditional contract a contract of adhesion a contract of indemnity and a contract which requires that the person insured have an insurable interest at the time of the insured against contingency personal contract property and liability insurance policies cover persons and not property or operations although the terms insured my house or insured my motorcycle are used commonly they are not technically correct the contract between the insurer and the insured is a personal contract between an insuring entity and a person s and not the object being insured in other words the question of whether payment is due upon the occurrence of a contingency and how such payment will be measured depends upon economic loss suffered by the person s conditional contract property and liability insurance policies are said to be conditional contracts because the obligation of the insurer to perform may be conditioned upon the insured satisfying certain conditions contract of adhesion property and liability insurance policies are said to be contracts of adhesion because the insurer and insured parties are of unequal bargaining power where the insured party cannot negotiate the terms of the contract and must take the offer of the insurer as made importantly the rule of law regarding contracts of adhesion is that any ambiguities resolve in favor of the insured contract of indemnity property and liability insurance policies are said to be contracts of indemnity because the purpose of insurance is to indemnify the insured the principle of indemnification is that the insured should not profit nor incur an economic loss from the response provided by the policy insurable interest insurable interest is one wherein economic loss would be suffered from an adverse occurrence to the person s insured indemnification an entity seeking to transfer risk an individual corporation or association of any type becomes the insured party once risk is assumed by an insurer the insuring party by means of a contract defined as an insurance policy this legal contract sets out terms and conditions specifying the amount of coverage compensation to be rendered to the insured by the insurer upon assumption of risk in the event of a loss and all the specific perils covered against indemnified for the term of the contract when insured parties experience a loss for a specified peril the coverage entitles the policyholder to make a claim against the insurer for the amount of loss as specified by the policy contract the fee paid by the insured to the insurer for assuming the risk is called the premium insurance premiums from many clients are used to fund accounts set aside for later payment of claims in theory for a relatively few claimants and for overhead costs so long as an insurer maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses the remaining margin becomes their profit how an insurance company makes money a customer might pay one or more premium payments over time the company collects these payments from one or more customers if something happens which triggers a claim the company then pays out a certain amount of money if during the lifetime of all of the company s insurance contracts it pays out less than it has taken in it makes what is known as an underwriting profit one measure of an insurance company s performance is their loss ratio incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses divided by net earned premium the loss ratio is added to the expense ratio underwriting expenses divided by net premium written to determine the company s combined ratio the combined ratio is a reflection of the company s overall underwriting profitability a combined ratio of less than one zero zero percent indicates a profit while anything over one zero zero is a loss one company that is famous for achieving underwriting profit is american international group berkshire hathaway by contrast is famous for making its money on float rather than underwriting profit float is the concept that as insurance premiums are collected up front and claims paid over time sometimes up to periods of one zero years or more the insurance companies are able to collect investment income on the money they have reserved for claims that have not occurred yet or have not yet been paid over time this interest is compounded into significant dollars particularly for a company as large as berkshire hathaway in many cases a company s combined ratio is greater than one zero zero percent however the company still manages to make money this is because in between the time the company collects premiums and when it pays out claims it can invest that money the return from these investments may offset an underwriting loss resulting in profit for example if a company has to pay out one zero percent more than it took in but made a two zero percent return on its investment then it made a one zero percent profit however since most insurance companies consider it only prudent and may be mandated to do so by laws controlling insurance businesses in the territory in which they operate to invest in risk free government bonds or other lower risk and lower return forms of investments it s important that the extra amount it has to pay out compared to what it has to take in is less than the percent return of these investments if it isn t the company loses money the extra amount that a company has to pay out can be considered a cost of funds and be compared to an interest rate of the same company borrowing money because of this most insurance companies don t have a goal just to have any amount of profit over the cost of funds but rather to have this cost of funds be lower than what they would have been able to get by borrowing somewhere else if this isn t the case the insurance company does not add any value to their owners who theoretically could have borrowed money from somewhere else and made the same investments themselves although insurers traditionally depended upon underwriting profit to provide them with operating profit market forces now require that insurers earn the bulk of their profit on investment income on premiums held pending claims occurrence this is a form of financial leveraging determination of rate structures the insurer uses actuarial science to quantify the risk they are willing to assume data is generated to approximate future claims ordinarily with reasonable accuracy actuarial science uses statistics and probability to analyze the risks associated with the range of perils covered and these scientific principles are used by insurers in conjunction with additional factors to determine rate structures for example many individuals purchase homeowner s insurance policies by signing a contract paying a premium to an insurance company if a covered loss occurs the insurer is obliged by the terms of the contract to honor the insured s claim for some policyholders the amount of insurance benefits received from their insurer will greatly exceed the expense of premiums paid others may never make a claim or receive any benefit other than the peace of mind rendered by the security of an insurance policy when averaged the total claims expense paid by an insurer should be less than the total premiums paid by their policyholders with the difference allocated to overhead and profit insurance companies also earn investment profits these are generated by investing premiums received until they are needed to pay claims this money is called the float the insurer may make profits or losses from the value change in the float as well as interest or dividends on the float in the united states the underwriting loss of property and casualty insurance companies was one four two three billion in the five years ending two zero zero three but overall profit for the same period was six eight four billion at the result of float some insurance industry insiders most notably hank greenberg do not believe that it is forever possible to sustain a profit from float without an underwriting profit as well but this opinion is not universally held gambling analogy some people erroneously consider insurance a type of wager particularly as associated with moral hazard that executes over the policy period the insurance company bets that you or your property will not suffer a loss while you put money on the opposite outcome the difference in the fees paid to the insurance company versus the amount for which they can be held liable if an accident happens is roughly analogous to the odds one might expect when betting on a racehorse for example one zero to one for this reason a number of religious groups including the amish and muslims avoid insurance and instead depend on support provided by their communities when disasters strike this can be thought of as social insurance as the risk of any given person is assumed collectively by the community who will all bear the cost of rebuilding in closed supportive communities where others can be trusted to step in to rebuild lost property this arrangement can work however most societies could not effectively support this type of system and the system will not work for large risks for very large risks western insurance can also run into difficulties this is the reason why most homeowner s insurance does not cover floods a company that sells homeowner s insurance in a given city can accurately estimate the number of claims it would have to pay due to fires tornadoes and other smaller scale disasters however a flood may impact a large percentage of the city and the company might be unable to deal with this a prime example of this is the flooding in new orleans as a result of hurricane katrina for the same reason losses due to war and earthquakes are generally excluded in the case of floods and earthquakes which are smaller scale than war homeowners can purchase separate insurance from national companies with larger resources which are able to distribute the risk across regions rather than individual buildings in gaming or gambling the game is fixed at the start so that the odds are not affected by the players however to obtain certain types of insurance such as fire insurance policyholders are often required to conduct risk mitigation practices such as installing sprinklers and using fireproof building materials to reduce the odds of loss to fire in addition after a proven loss insurers specialize in providing rehabilitation to minimize the total loss while insurance is analogous to gambling in terms of risk and reward the main difference is in the motivation behind the process risk seeking vs risk avoidance when gambling you are assuming risk that you would not otherwise be exposed to that has the possibility of either a loss or a gain speculative risk with insurance you are managing risk that you could not otherwise avoid and which does not present the possibility of gain pure risk risk management the practice of appraising and controlling risk has evolved as a discrete field of study and practice avoiding mitigating and transferring certain risk creates greater predictability for consumers and business and allows people and organizations to use risk intelligently to maximize their opportunities historically gambling has been considered an uninsurable risk recent developments however have lead to the invention and patenting of new types of insurance to protect against gambling losses an example is united states patent six eight six nine three six two method and apparatus for providing insurance policies for gambling losses history of insurance early methods of transferring or distributing risk were practiced by babylonian traders as long ago as the two nd millennium bce the babylonians developed a system which was recorded in the famous code of hammurabi c one seven five zero bc and practiced by early mediterranean sailing merchants if a merchant received a loan to fund his shipment he would pay the lender an additional sum in exchange for the lender s guarantee to cancel the loan should the shipment be stolen a thousand years later the inhabitants of rhodes invented the concept of the general average merchants whose goods were being shipped together would pay a proportionally divided premium which would be used to reimburse any merchant whose goods were jettisoned during storm or sinkage the greeks and romans introduced the origins of health and life insurance c six zero zero ad when they organized guilds called benevolent societies which acted to care for the families and funeral expenses of members upon death guilds in the middle ages served a similar purpose the talmud deals with several aspects of insuring goods before insurance was established in the late one seven th century friendly societies existed in england in which people donated amounts of money to a general sum that could be used in case of emergency insurance became far more sophisticated in post renaissance europe and specialized varieties developed toward the end of the seventeenth century the growing importance of london as a center for trade led to rising demand for marine insurance in the late one six eight zero s mr edward lloyd opened a coffee house which became a popular haunt of ship owners merchants and ships captains and thereby a reliable source of the latest shipping news it became the meeting place for parties wishing to insure cargoes and ships and those willing to underwrite such ventures today lloyd s of london remains the leading market for marine and other specialist types of insurance but it works rather differently than the more familiar kinds of insurance insurance as we know it today can be traced to the great fire of london which in one six six six devoured one three two zero zero houses in the aftermath of this disaster nicholas barbon opened an office to insure buildings in one six eight zero he established england s first fire insurance company the fire office to insure brick and frame homes the first insurance company in the united states provided fire insurance and was formed in charles town modern day charleston south carolina in one seven three two benjamin franklin helped to popularize and make standard the practice of insurance particularly against fire in the form of perpetual insurance in one seven five two he founded the philadelphia contributionship for the insurance of houses from loss by fire franklin s company was the first to make contributions toward fire prevention not only did his company warn against certain fire hazards it refused to insure certain buildings where the risk of fire was too great such as all wooden houses in the united states regulation of the insurance industry is highly balkanized with primary responsibility assumed by individual state insurance departments whereas insurance markets have become centralized nationally and internationally state insurance commissioners operate individually though at times in concert through a national insurance commissioner s organization in recent years some have called for a federal regulatory system for insurance similar to that of the banking industry in the state of new york which has unique laws in keeping with its stature as a global business center attorney general eliot spitzer has been in a unique position to grapple with major national insurance brokerages spitzer alleged that marsh perils examples of perils might be fire theft earthquake hurricane and many other potential risks an insurance policy will set out in details which perils are covered by the policy and which are not types of insurance companies insurance companies may be classified as life insurance companies who sell life insurance annuities and pensions products non life or general insurance companies who sell other types of insurance in most countries life and non life insurers are subject to different regulations tax and accounting rules the main reason for the distinction between the two types of company is that life business is very long term in nature coverage for life assurance or a pension can cover risks over many decades by contrast non life insurance cover usually covers a shorter period such as one year insurance companies are generally classified as either mutual or stock companies this is more of a traditional distinction as true mutual companies are becoming rare mutual companies are owned by the policyholders while stockholders who may or may not own policies own stock insurance companies reinsurance companies are insurance companies that sell policies to other insurance companies allowing them to reduce their risks and protect themselves from very large losses the reinsurance market is dominated by a few very large companies with huge reserves captive insurance companies may be defined as limited purpose insurance companies established with the specific objective of financing risks emanating from their parent group or groups this definition can sometimes be extended to include some of the risks of the parent company s customers in short terms it is an in house self insurance vehicle captives may take the form of a pure entity which is a one zero zero a subsidiary of the self insured parent company of a mutual captive which insures the collective risks of industry members and of an association captive which self insures individual risks of the members of a professional commercial or industrial association captives represent commercial economic and tax advantages to their sponsors due to the reductions on costs they help create the ease for insurance risk management and the flexibility for cash flows they generate additionally they may provide coverage of risks which are neither available nor offered in the traditional insurance market at reasonable prices the types of risk that a captive can underwrite for the parent include property damage public and products liability professional indemnity employee benefits employers liability motor and medical aid expenses the captive s exposure to such risks may be limited by the use of reinsurance captives are becoming an increasingly important component of the risk management and risk financing strategy of their parent this can be understood against the following background heavy and increasing premium costs in almost every line of coverage difficulties in insuring certain types of fortuitous risk differential coverage standards in various parts of the world rating structures which reflect market trends rather than individual loss experience insufficient credit for deductibles and or loss control efforts there are also companies known as insurance consultants like a mortgage broker these companies are paid a fee by the customer to shop around for the best insurance policy amongst many companies similar to an insurance consultant an insurance broker also shops around for the best insurance policy amongst many companies however with insurance brokers the fee is usually paid in the form of commission from the insurer that is selected rather than directly from the client third party administrators are companies that perform underwriting and sometimes claims handling services for insurance companies these companies often have special expertise that the insurance companies do not have life insurance and saving certain life insurance contracts accumulate cash values which may be taken by the insured if the policy is surrendered or which may be borrowed against some policies such as annuities and endowment policies are financial instruments to accumulate or liquidate wealth when it is needed see life insurance in many countries such as the us and the uk tax law provides that the interest on this cash value is not taxable under certain circumstances this leads to widespread use of life insurance as a tax efficient method of saving as well as protection in the event of early death financial viability of insurance companies financial stability and strength of the insurance company should be a major consideration when purchasing an insurance contract an insurance premium paid currently provides coverage for losses that might arise many years in the future for that reason the viability of the insurance carrier is very important in recent years a number of insurance companies have become insolvent leaving their policyholders with no coverage or coverage only from a government backed insurance pool with less attractive payouts for losses a number of independent rating agencies such as best s provide information and rate the financial viability of insurance companies controversies insurance insulates too much by creating a security blanket for its insureds an insurance company may inadvertently find that its insureds may not be as risk averse as they should be since the insured assumes the risk belongs to the insurer this problem is known to the insurance industry as moral hazard to reduce their own financial exposure insurance companies have contractual clauses that mitigate their obligation to provide coverage if the insured engages in some kind of behavior that grossly magnifies their risk of loss or liability for example liability insurance providers do not provide coverage for liability arising from intentional torts committed by the insured even if a provider was irrational enough to try to provide such coverage it is against the public policy of most countries to allow such insurance to exist and thus it is usually illegal complexity of insurance policy contracts insurance policies can be complex and some policyholders may not understand all the fees regulation and coverages included in a policy as a result people could buy policies at unfavorable terms in response to these issues governments often make detailed regulations that set down minimum standards for policies and govern how they may be advertised and sold many individuals purchase policies through an insurance broker the broker can counsel the policyholder on which coverage to purchase and limitations of the policy a broker generally holds contracts with many insurers which allows the broker to shop the market for the best rates and coverage possible redlining redlining is the practice of some insurance companies to deny the issuance of coverage in specific geographic areas usually due to an increased likelihood of risk the validity of the assessment may be real or perceived though it is often attributed to discrimination evaluation of risk when an insurer determines a premium or premium rate structure considers quantifiable factors including location credit scores gender occupation marital status and education level however the use of these essential factors whether inappropriately or not are often considered to be unfair or discriminatory by some consumers and their advocates sometimes leading to political disputes about insurers determination of premiums and possible government intervention to limit the factors used a refutation to this is that the job of an insurance underwriter is to properly categorize a given risk as to the likelihood that the loss will occur any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should in theory be charged a higher rate this is a basic principle of insurance and must be followed for insurance companies or groups to operate properly even for non profit organizations thus discrimination of potential insureds by legitimate factors is central to insurance therefore the only thing that can be considered legitimately unfair are practices that discriminate against a given group without actual factors that show that the group is a higher risk so eliminating real factors discriminates against other insureds by forcing them to bear part of the cost of the disallowed perceived factors health insurance health insurance which is coverage for individuals to protect them against medical costs is a highly charged and political issue in the united states which does not have socialized health coverage in theory the market for health insurance provision should function in a manner similar to other insurance coverages but the skyrocketing cost of health coverage has disrupted markets around the globe but perhaps most glaringly in the us please see health insurance for a discussion of this category dental insurance dental insurance like health insurance is coverage for individuals to protect them against dental costs dental insurance usually goes hand in hand with health insurance with most people in the united states receiving it included in their health insurance plan from their employer along with receiving dental insurance from your employer there are ways to receive dental insurance through resellers and companies for individuals and families although this way tends to be too expensive for most people insurance patents new insurance products can now be protected from copying with a business method patent this may lead to the more rapid introduction of new insurance products as insurance companies will invest more heavily in new product development if they can be reasonably assured that their patents will keep those products from being copied a recent example of a new insurance product that is patented is telematic auto insurance it was independently invented and patented by a major us auto insurance company progressive auto insurance us patent five seven nine seven one three four and a spanish independent inventor salvador minguijon perez european patent ep zero seven zero zero zero zero nine b one the basic idea of telematic auto insurance is that a driver s behavior is monitored directly while the person drives and this information is transmitted to an insurance company the insurance company then assesses the risk of that driver having an accident and charges insurance premiums accordingly a driver that drives a lot of distance at high speed for example will be charged a higher rate than a driver that drives small distances at low speed a british auto insurance company norwich union has taken a license to both the progressive patent and perez patent they have made additional investments in infrastructure and developed a commercial offering called pay as you drive or payd many independent inventors are in favor of patenting new insurance products since it gives them protection from big companies when they bring their new insurance products to market independent inventors account for seven zero of the new us patent applications in this area many insurance executives are opposed to patenting insurance products because it creates a new risk for them the hartford insurance company for example had to recently pay us eight zero million to an independent inventor bancorp services in order to settle a patent infringement and theft of trade secret lawsuit for a new type of corporate owned life insurance product invented and patented by bancorp there are currently about one five zero new patent applications on insurance inventions filed per year in the united states source insurance ip bulletin december one five two zero zero five only about two zero three zero patents per year however are actually issuing the insurance industry and rent seeking certain insurance products and practices have been described as rent seeking by critics that is insurance companies have been alleged to have certain products or practices that are only useful due to certain government laws especially tax laws and that the insurance industry in these cases generally adds no economic value but instead supports politicians who will continue the legal regime which gives the insurance company these benefits for example in the united states the current tax rules generally allow owners of variable annuities see annuity us financial products and variable life insurance see variable universal life insurance to invest in the stock market and defer or eliminate paying any taxes until withdrawals are made sometimes this tax deferral is the only reason some individuals use these products instead of a mutual fund another example is the legal infrastructure which allows life insurance to be held in an irrevocable trust which is used to pay an estate tax while the proceeds itself are immune from the estate tax insurance in blackjack in the casino game insurance is an optional play that requires the player to bet one two of his current bet to the posibilitiy of the house drawing a blackjack an ace and a ten if the house does draw a blackjack all insured players get their bet back including the insurance if not the insurance is lost and the game continues as normal a player can only buy insurance if the house open card is an ace and only at the beginning of his turn according to game theory it is statistically unwise to buy insurance given that the potential win is not enough to justify the risk of losing there are one two different cards and either four or one are any good if insurance is possible glossary combined ratio loss ratio expense ratio loss ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of losses by the amount of written premium expense ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of operational expenses by the amount of earned premium a lower number indicates a better return on the amount of capital placed at risk by an insurer quote hank

india from one nine january one nine six six to two four march one nine seven seven and again from one four january one nine eight zero until her assassination on three one october one nine eight four the daughter of prime minister jawaharlal nehru and not related to mahatma gandhi she was one of modern india s most notable and politically controversial leaders early years the nehru family can trace their ancestry to the brahmins of jammu and kashmir and delhi indira s grandfather motilal nehru was a wealthy barrister of allahabad in what is now uttar pradesh nehru was one of the most prominent members of the indian national congress in pre gandhi times and would go on to author the nehru report the people s choice for a future indian system of government as opposed to the british system her father jawaharlal nehru was a well educated lawyer and was a popular leader of the indian independence movement indira was born to his young wife kamala at this juncture nehru entered the independence movement with mahatma gandhi growing up in the sole care of her mother who was sick and alienated from the nehru household indira developed strong protective instincts and a loner personality her grandfather and father continually being enmeshed in national politics also made mixing with her peers difficult she had conflicts with her father s sisters and these continued into the political world indira created the vanara sena movement for young girls and boys which played a small but notable role in the indian independence movement conducting protests and flag marches as well as helping congress politicians circulate sensitive publications and banned materials in an often told story indira smuggled out from her father s police watched house an important document in her schoolbag that outlined plans for a major revolutionary initiative in the early one nine three zero s in one nine three six her mother kamala nehru finally succumbed to tuberculosis after a long struggle indira was one seven at the time and thus never experienced a stable family life during her childhood indira attended prominent indian european and british schools like santiniketan and oxford but her weak academic performance prevented her from obtaining a degree in her years in continental europe and the u k she met feroze gandhi a young parsee congress activist whom she married in one nine four two just before the beginning of the quit india movement the final all out national revolt launched by gandhi and the congress party indira and feroze were arrested and detained for several months for their involvement in the movement in one nine four four indira gave birth to rajiv gandhi followed two years later by sanjay gandhi during the traumatic partition of india in one nine four seven indira helped organize refugee camps and provide medical care for the millions of refugees from pakistan this was her first exercise in major public service and a valuable experience for the tumult of the coming years personal life the couple later settled in allahabad where feroze worked for a congress party newspaper and an insurance company their marriage started out well but deteriorated later as indira moved to delhi to be at the side of her father the prime minister who was living alone in a high pressure environment indira became his constant confidante secretary and nurse the boys lived with her and the separation eventually became permanent when india s first general election approached in one nine five two indira managed the campaigns of both nehru and her husband who was contesting the constituency of rae bareilly feroze had not consulted nehru on his choice to run and even though he was elected he opted to live in a separate house in delhi feroze quickly developed a reputation for being a fighter against corruption by exposing a major scandal in the nationalized insurance industry resulting in the resignation of the finance minister a nehru aide at the height of the tension it was known to both that feroze was having extramarital affairs however in one nine five seven shortly after re election feroze suffered a heart attack which dramatically healed indira s broken marriage at his side to help him recuperate in kashmir indira her husband and her children grew closer but feroze died on eight september one nine six zero while indira was abroad with nehru on a foreign visit rise to power from one nine five nine one nine six zero indira was elected the president of the indian national congress her term of office was uneventful indira also acted as her father s chief of staff nehru was known as a vocal opponent of nepotism and indira did not contest a seat in the one nine six two elections nehru died in may of one nine six four and indira at the urgings of the new prime minister lal bahadur shastri contested elections and joined the government being immediately appointed minister for information and broadcasting she went to chennai when the riots over hindi becoming the national language broke out in southern non hindi speaking states there she spoke to government officials soothed the anger of community leaders and supervised reconstruction efforts for the affected areas shastri and senior ministers were embarrassed owing to their lack of such initiative indira s actions were probably not directly aimed at shastri or her own political elevation indira lacked interest for details in work and was a lack lustre minister but she was media savvy and adept at the art of politics and image making when the indo pakistani war of one nine six five broke out indira was vacationing in the border region of srinagar although warned by the army that pakistani insurgents had penetrated very close to the city indira refused to shift to jammu or delhi she rallied local government and welcomed media attention in effect reassuring the nation indira was hailed as the only man in a cabinet full of women shastri died in tashkent while conducting the peace agreement with pakistan s ayub khan with soviet mediation the circumstances of his death are unclear to this day it is alleged that seniors in the congress party changed the prime minister s personal aides at the very last moment others feel it was an assassination made to order since indira was elected in rather undue haste as the person to succeed him shastri had been a candidate of consensus bridging the left right gap and staving off the conservative morarji desai among indira s many supporters was congress president kumaraswami kamaraj many years later kamaraj declared that he had made a personal vow to nehru to make indira the prime minister at any cost nehru had assisted kamaraj earlier in his political ambitions and had made him the general secretary of the congress party kamaraj could speak only his native tamil nehru s insistence at having kamaraj in the most important post had raised eyebrows earlier in a vote of the congress parliamentary party indira won against desai three five five to one six nine becoming the third prime minister of india the first woman to hold that position in the world s most populous democracy richard nixon and indira gandhi in one nine seven one nuclear security and the green revolution during the one nine seven one war the us had sent its seven th fleet to the bay of bengal as a warning to india not to use the genocide in east pakistan as a pretext to launch a wider attack against west pakistan especially over the disputed territory of kashmir this move had further alienated india from the first world and indira now accelerated a previously cautious new direction in national security and foreign policy india and the ussr had earlier signed the treaty of friendship and mutual cooperation the resulting political and military support contributing substantially to india s victory in the one nine seven one war but indira now also accelerated the national nuclear program as it was felt that the nuclear threat from china and the intrusive interest of the two major superpowers were not conducive to india s stability and security indira also invited the new pakistani president zulfikar ali bhutto to shimla for a week long summit after near failure of the talks bhutto and indira eventually signed the shimla agreement which bound the two countries to resolve the kashmir dispute by negotiations and peaceful means indira gandhi was heavily criticized for not extracting the pakistan occupied portion of kashmir from a humiliated pakistan whose nine three zero zero zero pows were under indian control but the agreement did remove immediate united nations and third party interference and much reduced the likelihood of pakistan launching a major attack in the near future by not demanding total capitulation on a sensitive issue from bhutto indira had allowed pakistan to stabilize and normalize trade relations were also normalized though much contact remained frozen for years in one nine seven four india successfully conducted an underground nuclear test near the desert village of pokhran in rajasthan describing the test as for peaceful purposes india nevertheless became the world s youngest nuclear power this move naturally prompted pakistan s nuclear program special agricultural innovation programs and extra government support launched in the one nine six zero s had finally resulted in india s chronic food shortages gradually being transformed into major production surpluses of wheat rice cotton and milk the country became a food exporter and diversified its commercial crop production as well in what has become known as the green revolution at the same time the white revolution was an expansion in milk production which helped to combat malnutrition especially amidst young children indira s economic policies while socialistic brought major industrialization as well the pm s personal life indira gandhi heroine and icon that she had become after one nine seven one just like her father was now more emotionally isolated than ever the instability of her childhood had prevented her from developing her own independent personal interests and lifestyle it had been her sense of duty and pride in her father and family legacy that had brought her into politics but she had never been given the space to develop as a person through the one nine five zero s and one nine six zero s she had corresponded with dorothy norman a new york based journalist who became a very close friend via correspondence but apart from political associates she had no personal friends her sons were studying in england neither obtained any formal degrees from any university and in a sense were failures professionally she was fond of her grandchildren but she grew ever more close to her younger son sanjay who is accused by many historians of misusing his mother s emotional dependence indira gandhi may have seen traits of feroze in sanjay and was ever anxious to please him as she perceived that sanjay blamed her for his father s death while rajiv developed as an independent young man free from politics sanjay s reckless youth induced a need in his mother to take care of her son under all circumstances the outcome was a political partnership that eventually resulted in abrogation of democracy corruption and abuse of power on a previously unwitnessed scale rajiv gandhi is believed to have said that he would never forgive his brother for what he had done to their mother at a time when indira was isolated depressed and humiliated after her defeat in the one nine seven seven elections emergency indira s government faced major problems after one nine seven one sycophancy enveloped her administration leaving the congress party entirely dependent on her leadership for its election fortunes socialism and a burgeoning bureaucracy brought major inefficiency and corruption into the national economy and administration the green revolution was transforming the lives of india s vast underclasses but not with the speed promised under garibi hatao job growth was not strong enough to curb the widespread unemployment a government contract to build india s first indigenous car was awarded to sanjay gandhi whose maruti company subsequently failed to produce a single unit indira had stood accused of authoritarianism before using her strong parliamentary majority she had amended the constitution and stripped power from the states granted under the federal system the congress party government had repeatedly imposed president s rule by deeming states ruled by opposition parties as lawless and chaotic thus winning administrative control of those states elected officials resented the growing influence of sanjay gandhi who had become indira s close political advisor at the expense of men like p n haksar the architect of indira s political ascendancy renowned public figures and former freedom fighters like jaya prakash narayan and acharya jivatram kripalani now spoke actively against her government opponents had long alleged that indira s party fraudulently won the one nine seven one elections in june one nine seven five the high court of allahabad found the sitting prime minister guilty of employing a government servant in her election campaign and congress party work technically this constituted election fraud and the court thus ordered her to be removed from her seat in parliament and banned from running in elections for six years it was known that the congress party were indulging in shady practices for a long time but this was the first time that a judge had acted dramatically against that corruption indira appealed the decision the opposition parties rallied en masse calling for her resignation strikes by unions and protest rallies paralyzed life in many states j p narayan s janata coalition even called upon the police to disobey orders if asked to fire on an unarmed public public disenchantment combined with hard economic times and an unresponsive government a huge rally surrounded the parliament building and indira s residence in delhi demanding her to behave responsibly and resign indira advised president fakhruddin ali ahmed to declare a state of emergency ahmed was an old political ally and in india the president acts upon the advice of an elected pm alone this former governor of a border state had organized the infiltration of several million bangladeshis into india claiming patriotism some indians saw this alliance as a political evil having secured a state of emergency indira called out the police and the army to break up the strikes and protests ordering the arrest of all opposition leaders many of these were men who had first gone to jail fighting the british in the one nine three zero s and one nine four zero s curfews indiscriminate charges and unlimited powers of detention were granted to police while all publications were directly censored by the ministry for information and broadcasting elections were indefinitely postponed and non congress state governments were dismissed the prime minister pushed a series of increasingly harsh bills and constitutional amendments through parliament with little discussion or debate indira attempted to re write the nation s laws to protect herself from legal prosecution once emergency rule was revoked still indira did not feel her powers were amassing quickly enough so she utilized president fakhruddin ali ahmed an indira loyalist to issue extraordinary laws that bypassed parliament altogether allowing her to rule by decree inder kumar gujral future prime minister but then indira s minister for information and broadcasting resigned to protest sanjay s interference in his ministry s work with a few exceptions everyone fell in line to indira and sanjay s style of rule sychophancy and servile attitude in politics were encouraged and came to stay indira s emergency rule lasted nineteen months during this time in spite of the controversy involved the country made significant economic and industrial progress this was primarily due to the end it put to strikes in factories colleges and universities and the disciplining of trade and student unions production and government work became more efficient tax evasion was reduced by zealous government officials although corruption remained agricultural and industrial production expanded considerably under indira s two zero point programme revenues increased and so did india s financial standing in the international community against this must be counted the arrest and torture of thousands of political activists the ruthless clearing of slums around delhi s jama masjid area ordered by sanjay which left hundreds of thousands of people homeless and thousands killed and the family planning program which forcibly imposed vasectomy on thousands of fathers and was often poorly administered nurturing a public anger against family planning that persists into the two one st century in one nine seven seven greatly misjudging her own popularity indira called elections and was roundly defeated to the surprise of some observers she meekly agreed to step down although the theory has been proposed that field marshall sam maneckshaw chief of army staff threatened her by suggesting the possibility of forcible removal ouster arrest and return the unwieldy janata party coalition came to power in the one nine seven seven elections morarji desai indira s long time opponent became prime minister and neelam sanjiva reddy the establishment choice of one nine six nine became president of the republic indira had lost her seat and found herself without work income or residence the congress party split and veteran indira supporters like jagjivan ram abandoned her for janata the congress indira party was now a much smaller group in parliament although the official opposition unable to govern owing to fractious coalition warfare the janata government s home minister choudhary charan singh ordered the arrest of indira and sanjay gandhi on a slew of charges her arrest and long running trial however projected the image of a helpless woman being victimized by the government and this triggered indira s political rebirth the people were already dissatisfied with a dysfunctional government a stagnant economy disorderly coalition governments at the state levels near continuous strikes and disorder and frustratingly stalled trials of emergency era culprits millions of poor people recalled their former icon and the middle classes recalled the order peace and progress of the emergency they were disenchanted by the return of elections and freedom of expression noting the disorder it caused indira began giving speeches again tacitly apologizing for mistakes made during the emergency and garnering support from icons like vinoba bhave desai resigned in june one nine seven nine and charan singh was appointed prime minister by the president singh attempted to form a government with his janata secular coalition but lacked a majority charan singh bargained with indira for the support of congress i mps causing uproar by his unhesitant coddling of his biggest political opponent after a short interval indira withdrew her initial support and president neelam sanjiva reddy dissolved parliament calling fresh elections in one nine eight zero indira s congress i party was returned to power with a landslide majority operation blue star and assassination time magzine covered a feature on mrs gandhi after her assasination indira gandhi found her toughest opponent in jarnail singh bhindranwale much misunderstanding has existed in the state controlled indian press regarding this charismatic leader of the sikhs there is no evidence to believe that he began the movement for khalistan even though indira gandhi labelled him a separatist on september one nine eight one bhindrawale voluntarily offered his arrest in amritsar where he was detained and interrogated for twenty five days but was released because of lack of evidence after his release bhindranwale relocated himself from his headquarters at mehta chowk to guru nanak niwas within the darbar sahib precincts this move of bhindrawale is generally seen as the reason for indira gandhi s attack on the darbar sahib the indian army however attacked not only this important shine but three seven additional shrines across punjab where there were no sikh nationalists or militants in residence bhindranwale s presence at the shrine therefore was a minor factor if a factor at all in indira gandhi s decision to attack the sikh vatican in fact the then deputy commissioner of amritsar gurdev singh said that he had categorically informed the highest officials of the punjab government that if they wanted to arrest bhindranwale there would be no major difficulty in organizing it the chief minister the governor of punjab and other senior officials told him that the directive to take action against bhindranwale had to come from delhi these orders never came because bhindranwale had no outstanding charges against him arun shourie of the indian express noted for all i know he bhindranwale is completely innocent and is genuinely and exclusively dedicated to the teachings of the gurus in december one nine eight three a senior officer in chandigarh confessed it s really shocking that we have so little against him bhindranwale while we keep blaming him for all sorts of things therefore to think that bhindranwale invited an attack from the indian army through his presence at the darbar sahib is to ignore an established fact that the army operation was planned well in advance as stated by s k sinha a major figure in the indian army the attack had been planned several months beforehand and was timed for an important anniversary in the sikh calendar when thousands of pilgrims would be expected to be present the army operation was followed by wholesale killings of sikh males between the ages of one five and three five in punjab s villages these violent events together with organized massacre of sikhs in india s major cities in november one nine eight four and daily terror families subsequently experienced in punjab s villages gave rise to

comes from her marriage to feroze gandhi a parsi legacy until this day indira s legacy as prime minister remains mixed she was a strong forceful personality and her reign was popular with some segments of india s population especially the left her phrase poverty is the greatest pollutor in her remarkable speech at the first un world environmental conference in stockholm in one nine seven two set her and india at the time apart in attempting to harmonise environmental and developmental concerns in developing countries in her early struggles to gain control of the congress party she transformed indian politics by appealing directly to the people and subverting the established structure of congress the inadvertent result of this was fragmentation of the political hierarchy resulting in the later rise of parties such as the bsp and the samajwadi party allowing previously marginalised communities to gain political representation some suggest that indira despite her heavy handed tactics and mistakes was vital for india s democracy and unity citing the faith in democracy of hundreds of millions of people united only in poverty and ignorance depended upon iconic leaders and guardians it is suggested that the only viable alternative for india was to trade democracy for a dictatorship in view of the national insecurity and economic deprivation that defined the one nine

intergovernmentalism is a theory of decision making in international organizations where power is possessed by the member states and decisions are made by unanimity independent appointees of the governments or elected representatives have solely advisory or implementational functions intergovernmentalism is used by most international organizations today an alternative method of decision making in international organizations is supranationalism intergovernmentalism is also a theory on european integration which rejects the idea of neofunctionalism the theory initially proposed by stanley hoffmann biography suggests that national governments control the level and speed of european integration any increase in power at supranational level he argues results from a direct decision by governments he believed that integration driven by national governments was often based on the domestic political and economic issues of the day the theory rejects the concept of the spill over effect that neofunctionalism proposes he also rejects the idea that supranational organisations are on an equal level in terms of political influence as national governments see also federation continental union european union mundialization federalism european union individualism is a moral political and social philosophy which emphasizes individual liberty the primary importance of the individual and the virtues of self reliance and personal independence individualism embraces opposition to authority and to all manner of controls over the individual especially when exercised by the political state or society it is thus directly opposed to collectivism which advocates subordination of the individual to the will of the society or community it is often confused with egoism but an individualist need not be an egoist political individualism in political philosophy the individualist theory of government holds that the state should take a merely defensive role by protecting the liberty of each individual to act as he wishes as long he does not infringe on the same liberty of another this contrasts with collectivist political theories where rather than leaving the individual to pursue his own ends the state ensures that the individual serves the interests of society when taken as a whole it also contrasts with fascism where the individual is required to serve the interests of the state the term has also been used to describe individual initiative and freedom of the individual in general perhaps best described by the french term laissez faire a verb meaning to let the people do for themselves what they know how to do in practice individualists are chiefly concerned with protecting individual autonomy by opposing encroachment by the state they pay particular attention to protecting the liberties of the minority against transgressions by the majority and see the individual as the smallest minority for example individualists oppose democratic systems unless constitutional protections exist that preserve individual liberty of individuals from being diminished by the interests of the majority these concerns encompass both civil and economic liberties one typical concern is the concentration of commercial and industrial enterprise in the hands of the state and the municipality the principles upon which this opposition is based are mainly two that popularly elected representatives are not likely to have the qualifications or the sense of responsibility required for dealing with the multitudinous enterprises and the large sums of public money involved in civic administration and that the health of the state depends upon the exertions of individuals for their personal benefit who like cells are the containers of the life of the body individualism may take a radicalist approach as in individualist anarchism the individualist sees society as a large number of individuals working together to improve their individual and collective welfare the single person is not just a member of a greater unity in fact the single individual is seen as the ultimate unity and society is nothing more than a composition of these individuals the state is an organized form of society which ensures the individual s freedom by law under the protections of a republic thus individualist policy tends to approve laws that protect or otherwise enhance the liberties of the individual citizen but rejects laws that subordinate the individual to the collective individualism and society jean jacques rousseau s social contract maintains that each individual is under implicit contract to submit his own will to the general will this advocacy of subordinating the individual will to a collective will is in fundamental opposition to the individualist philosophy an individualist enters into society to further his own interests or at least demands the right to serve his own interests without taking the interests of society into consideration an individualist need not be an egoist the individualist does not lend credence to any philosophy that requires the sacrifice of the self interest of the individual for any higher social causes societies and groups can differ in the extent to which they are based upon predominantly self regarding individualistic and arguably self interested rather than other regarding group oriented and group or society minded behaviour there is also a distinction relevant in this context between guilt societies e g medieval europe with an internal reference standard and shame societies e g japan bringing shame upon one s ancestors with an external reference standard where people look to their peers for feedback as to whether an action is acceptable or not also known as group think the extent to which society or groups are individualistic can vary from time to time and from country to country for example japanese society is more group oriented e g decisions tend to be taken by consensus among groups rather than by individuals and it has been argued that personalities are less developed than is usual in the west the usa is usually thought of as being at the individualistic its detractors would say atomistic end of the spectrum whereas european societies are more inclined to believe in public spiritedness state socialistic spending and in public initiatives john kenneth galbraith made a classic distinction between private affluence and public squalor in the usa and private squalor and public affluence in for example europe and there is a correlation between individualism and degrees of public sector intervention and taxation individualism is often contrasted with either totalitarianism or collectivism but in fact there is a spectrum of behaviours ranging at the societal level from highly individualistic societies e g the usa through mixed societies a term the uk has used in the post world war ii period to collectivist also many collectivists particularly supporters of anarchism or libertarian socialism point to the enormous differences between liberty minded collectivism and totalitarian practices individualism sometimes closely associated with certain variants of individualist anarchism libertarianism or classical liberalism typically takes it for granted that individuals know best and that public authority or society has the right to interfere in the person s decision making process only when a very compelling need to do so arises and maybe not even in those circumstances this type of argument is often observed in relation to policy debates regarding regulation of industries economic individualism the doctrine of economic individualism holds that each individual should be allowed autonomy in making his own economic decisions as opposed to those decisions being made by the state or the community for him morever it supports the liberty of individuals to own property as opposed to state or collective arrangements such an economic system is often called laissez faire or capitalism critics of modern capitalism sometimes argue that capitalism is not based on individuals but largely on firms and institutions and that individuals roles are largely determined by these institutions however compared to various forms of political collectivism capitalism is usually still considered as individualistic since participation in these institutions is voluntary and an individual choice yet capitalism can also thrive in certain collectivistic societies with individual choice the only difference is what the choice is based on individual need versus collective need individualism and us history at the time of the formation of the united states many of its citizens had fled from state or religious oppression in europe and were influenced by the egalitarian and fraternal ideals that later found expression in the french revolution such ideas influenced the framers of the u s constitution the jeffersonian democratic republicans who believed that the government should seek to protect individual rights in the constitution itself this idea later led to the bill of rights opposing views individualism has negative connotations in certain societies and environments where it is associated with selfishness for example individualism is highly frowned upon in japan where self interested behavior is traditionally regarded as a kind of betrayal of those to whom one has obligations e g family and firm the absence of universal health care in the united states which traces back to a belief in individual rather than societal responsibility is widely criticised in europe and other countries where universal health care usually funded through general taxation is seen as protecting individuals from the vagaries of health problems health care in the united states is provided through private insurance some people who cannot afford health insurance in the united states are eligible for medicaid a gvernment sponsored program medicare is generally only available to those who are disabled and to single mothers and their children not all doctors will accept medicare typically just doctors in poor areas of the country who might have a large number of medicare patients proponents of such public initiatives and social responsibility argue that their policies are beneficial for the individual and that excessive individualism may actually hurt the individuals themselves opponents hold that such public initiatives may have unintended consequences beyond the issues they are intended to address many individualists find the beneficial to the individual argument repugnant and argue that individualism is not about individual benefit so much as individual

is one who is born with genitalia and or secondary sex characteristics determined as neither exclusively male nor female or which combine features of the male and female sexes the terms hermaphrodite and pseudohermaphrodite introduced in the one nine th century are now considered misleading and stigmatizing and patient advocates call for these terms to be abandoned there is also a move to drop the term intersex replacing it with disorders of sex development dsd the phrase ambiguous genitalia refers specifically to genital appearance but not all intersex conditions result in atypical genital appearance overview according to the highest estimates fausto sterling et al two zero zero zero perhaps one percent of live births exhibit some degree of sexual ambiguity and that between zero one and zero two of live births are ambiguous enough to become the subject of specialist medical attention including surgery to disguise their sexual ambiguity other sources leonard sax two zero zero two estimate the incidence of true intersexual conditions as far lower at approximately zero zero one eight in typical fetal development the presence of the sry gene causes the fetal gonads to become testes the absence of it allows the gonads to continue to develop into ovaries thereafter the development of the internal reproductive organs and the external genitalia is determined by hormones produced by certain fetal gonads ovaries or testes and the cells response to them the initial appearance of the fetal genitalia a few weeks after conception is basically feminine a pair of urogenital folds with a small protuberance in the middle and the urethra behind the protuberance if the fetus has testes and if the testes produce testosterone and if the cells of the genitals respond to the testosterone the outer urogenital folds swell and fuse in the midline to produce the scrotum the protuberance grows larger and straighter to form the penis the inner urogenital swellings swell wrap around the penis and fuse in the midline to form the penile urethra because there is variation in all of these processes a child can be born with a sexual anatomy that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger than average clitoris or typically male masculine in appearance with a smaller than average penis that is open along the underside the appearance may be quite ambiguous describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia or as male genitals with a very small penis completely open along the midline hypospadic and empty scrotum there are dozens of named medical conditions that may lead to intersex anatomy fertility is variable the distinctions male pseudohermaphrodite female pseudohermaphrodite and especially true hermaphrodite are vestiges of one nine th century thinking that placed true sex in the histology microscopic appearance of the gonads the common habit in the two one st century of elevating the role of the sex chromosomes above all other factors when determining gender may be analogous to the older habit of finding true sex in the gonads though high school biology teaches that men have xy and women xx chromosomes in fact there are quite a few other possible combinations such as turner syndrome xo metafemale syndrome xxx klinefelter s syndrome xxy xyy xo xy xx male swyer syndrome xy female and there are many individuals who do not follow the typical patterns such as cases with four or even more sex chromosomes thus people nowadays may be more likely to look towards the sex chromosomes than for example the histology of the gonads however according to researcher eric vilain at the university of california los angeles the biology of gender is far more complicated than xx or xy chromosomes many different criteria have been proposed and there is little consensus biological causes of intersexuality typical males have sex chromosomes xy and typical females xx one biological definition of a male child is the presence of a y chromosome this definition has sometimes been used for sex determination at sports events but it caused much confusion because it doesn t always apply the most common cause of sexual ambiguity is congenital adrenal hyperplasia an endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands produce abnormally high levels of virilizing hormones in genetic females this leads to an appearance that may be slightly masculinized large clitoris to quite masculine in many cases individuals are neither xx nor xy the presence of one or two additional x chromosomes in a male xxy or xxxy may cause klinefelter s syndrome a single x chromosome xo is called turner s syndrome it is characterized by a lack or incomplete development of certain primary and secondary female characteristics and is associated with a range of medical issues sex chromosomal mosaicism or chimerism can cause what was once called true hermaphroditism the presence of both testicular and ovarian tissue in one individual in persistent mullerian duct syndrome the child has xy chromsomes typical of a male the child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce mullerian inhibiting factor during fetal development the following further xy cases leads to intersexuality androgen insensitivity syndrome they develop either partially or fully as females due to their bodies failing to respond to testosterone in the case of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome cais their tissues are totally insensitive to androgens and they will develop as females with normal female external organs however they will not develop a uterus or fallopian tubes due to the production of mullerian inhibiting factor by their testes at puberty breasts will develop due to the production of estrogen by the testes but no menstruation will occur due to the lack of a uterus the tissues of individuals with partial androgen insensitivity by contrast have partial sensitivity to testosterone but it is reduced compared to the male normal these individuals can develop with either male external anatomy or female external anatomy or some combination depending on the degree of insensitivity five alpha reductase deficiency in this condition individuals have testes as well as vagina and labia but with a small penis capable of ejaculation instead of a clitoris this penis however appears to be a clitoris at birth these individuals are normally raised as girls however come puberty their testes will descend their voice will deepen and they often will develop a male sexual identity but they develop only limited facial hair the number of people with this condition varies geographically depending on how much of a given population is interrelated excessive in utero exposure to androgens may lead to intersexuality in xx cases congenital adrenal hyperplasia female internal anatomy but ambiguous or male external genitalia and develop male secondary sexual characteristics progestin induced virilisation in this case the male hormones are caused by use of progestin a drug that was used in the one nine five zero s and one nine six zero s in order to prevent miscarriage these individuals have internal and external female anatomy they develop however some male secondary characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises a similar phenomenon occurs in cases where a cow brings two fraternal twins one male and one female to term because unlike humans such twins share hormones via their placental blood interface with the mother cow male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal cow and masculinize her brain the result is a freemartin unconventional heifer a cow that will eventually try to mount other cows the way that a bull would in xx male syndrome also called de la chapelle syndrome the resulting child is usually a phenotypically normal male but without sperm production this syndrome is sometimes the result of an abnormal interchange of the sry region from a y chromosome to an x chimerism according to the new england journal of medicine vol three three eight p one six six physicians in the western general hospital of edinburgh have reported on a child with a penis one testicle and an ovary and fallopian tube instead of a second testicle some of this child s body cells are xy male and some are xx female the child was conceived as the result of in vitro fertilization and it appears most likely that two embryos a male embryo and a female embryo fused before or soon after embryos were transferred to the mother s uterus this kind of condition where there is more than one set of cell lines with different sets of chromosomes making up the body is known as chimerism this kind of tetraploid chimerism can also occur naturally without in vitro fertilization see new england journal of medicine vol three four six p one five four five not all cases of chimerism involve intersexuality however there have been about four zero known cases worldwide of humans reproducing naturally and producing offspring with absolutely no genetic similarities between mother and child discovery health channel has produced a documentary on two families and their issues in dealing with chimerism it was called i am my own twin treatment of intersexuals by society intersexual individuals are treated in different ways by different cultures in some cultures intersexuals were included in larger third gender or gender blending social roles along with other individuals in most societies intersexed individuals have been expected to select one sex and conform to its gender role since the rise of modern medical science in western societies intersexuals with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either male or female genitals but there are increasing calls for recognition of the various degrees of intersexuality as healthy variations which should not be subject to correction some have attacked the common western practice of performing corrective surgery on the genitals of intersexuals as a western cultural equivalent of female genital mutilation despite the attacks on the practice most of the medical profession still supports it others have claimed that the talk about third sexes represents an ideological agenda to deride gender as a social construct whereas they believe gender is a biological reality corrective surgery is generally not necessary for protection of life or health but purely for aesthetic or social purposes it may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life which would have been avoided without the surgery in other cases negative consequences are avoided by surgery defenders of the practice argue that it is necessary for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female in order for them to function socially however many intersex individuals have resented the medical intervention and some have been so discontented with their surgically assigned gender as to opt for sexual reassignment surgery later in life the writer anne fausto sterling coined the words herm for hermaphrodite merm for an intersex person that most closely resembles a male and ferm for an intersex person that most closely resembles a female and proposed that these be recognized as sexes along with male and female however her use was tongue in cheek she no longer advocates these terms even as a rhetorical device see also hermaphrodite

living in vivo is used to indicate the presence of a whole living organism in distinction to a partial or dead organism or a computer model for example in vivo biological research differentiates whole organism research from in vitro research which is performed on organs tissues cells cellular components proteins or biomolecules clinical trials are a form of in vivo research albeit on humans in silico research refers to numerical simulation on a computer of for example a reaction between two proteins the in vivo in vitro dichotomy is also frequently used in a medical context e g in vivo in vitro fertilization in vivo research in vivo research is more suited to observe an overall effect than in vitro research which is better suited to deduce mechanisms of action in vitro research aims to describe and understand the effect of an experimental variable on a subset of an organism s components in vitro research has the advantage over in vivo research that there are fewer variables which can confound an experiment and that if an experimental effect is subtle the result will be more clearly visible in vivo research has the advantage over in vitro research that the experimental system is a more complex biological system this means that in vivo research will likely give a better indication of what will happen in a population when a compound is administered to or a procedure is performed on an animal model of disease this is why all new drugs must first undergo animal testing followed by clinical trials before they are released to the general population christopher lipinski s rationale for this observation is whether the aim is to discover drugs or to gain knowledge of biological systems the nature and properties of a chemical tool cannot be considered independently of the system it is to be tested in compounds that bind to isolated recombinant proteins are one thing chemical tools that can perturb cell function another and pharmacological agents that can be tolerated by a live organism and perturb its systems are yet another if it were simple to ascertain the properties required to develop a lead discovered in vitro to one that is active in vivo drug discovery would be as reliable as drug manufacturing lipinski two zero zero four the massive adoption of low cost in vitro molecular biology techniques has caused a move away from in vivo research

for floating point computation and is followed by many cpu and fpu implementations the standard defines formats for representing floating point numbers including zero and denormals and special values infinities and nans together with a set of floating point operations that operate on these values it also specifies four rounding modes and five exceptions including when the exceptions occur and what happens when they do occur ieee seven five four specifies four formats for representing floating point values single precision three two bit double precision six four bit single extended precision four three bit not commonly used and double extended precision seven nine bit usually implemented with eight zero bits only three two bit values are required by the standard the others are optional many languages specify that ieee formats and arithmetic be implemented although sometimes it is optional for example the c programming language which pre dated ieee seven five four now allows but does not require ieee arithmetic the c float typically is used for ieee single precision and double uses ieee double precision the full title of the standard is ieee standard for binary floating point arithmetic ansi ieee std seven five four one nine eight five and it is also known as iec six zero five five nine one nine eight nine binary floating point arithmetic for microprocessor systems originally the reference number was iec five five nine one nine eight nine anatomy of a floating point number following is a description of the standard s format for floating point numbers bit conventions used in this article bits within a word of width w are indexed by integers in the range zero to w one inclusive the bit with index zero is drawn on the right the lowest indexed bit is usually the least significant single precision three two bit a single precision binary floating point number is stored in a three two bit word one eight two three width in bits s exp fraction three one three zero two three two two zero bit index zero on right bias one two seven where s is the sign bit and exp is the exponent field the exponent is biased in the engineering sense of the word the value stored is offset by one two seven in this case from the actual value biasing is done because exponents have to be signed values in order to be able to represent both tiny and huge values but two s complement the usual representation for signed values would make comparison harder to solve this the exponent is biased before being stored by adjusting its value to put it within an unsigned range suitable for comparison so for a single precision number an exponent in the range one two six to one two seven is biased by adding one two seven to get a value in the range one to two five four zero and two five five have special meanings described below when interpreting the floating point number the bias is subtracted to retrieve the actual exponent the set of possible data values can be divided into the following classes zeroes normalised numbers denormalised numbers infinities nan not a number nans are used to represent undefined or invalid results such as the square root of a negative number the classes are primarily distinguished by the value of the exp field modified by the fraction consider the exp and fraction fields as unsigned binary integers exp will be in the range zero two five five class exp fraction zeroes zero zero denormalised numbers zero non zero normalised numbers one two five four any infinities two five five zero nan not a number two five five non zero for normalised numbers the most common exp is the biased exponent and fraction is the fractional part of the significand the number has value v v s two e m where s one positive numbers when s is zero s one negative numbers when s is one e exp one two seven in other words the exponent is stored with one two seven added to it also called biased with one two seven m one fraction in binary that is the significand is the binary number one followed by the radix point followed by the binary bits of fraction therefore one m six this is a normalised floating point number the fraction is the part at the right of the radix point filled with zero on the right until we get all two three bits that is one one zero one one zero one zero one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero

point numbers is usually best done using floating point instructions however this representation makes comparisons of some subsets of numbers possible on a byte by byte basis if they share the same byte order and the same sign and nans are excluded for example for two positive numbers a and b then a b is true whenever the unsigned binary integers with the same bit patterns and same byte order as a and b are also ordered a b in other words two positive floating point numbers known not to be nans can be compared with an unsigned binary integer comparison using the same bits providing the floating point numbers use the same byte order this ordering therefore cannot be used in portable code through a union in the c programming language this is an example of lexicographic ordering rounding floating point numbers the ieee standard has four different rounding modes unbiased which rounds to the nearest value if the number falls midway it is rounded to the nearest value with an

this article deals with catholic history between one one three four and one eight three four for other uses see inquisition disambiguation artistic representation of an auto de fe during the spanish inquisition one four seven five the term inquisition latin inquisitio haereticae pravitatis sanctum officium refers broadly to a number of historical movements surrounding the suppression of heresy by the roman catholic church there were four major movements starting with the medieval inquisition in one one eight four and ending with the spanish inquisition in one eight three four origin the inquisition was an institution within the roman catholic church charged with the eradication of heresy sometimes by violent means heresies from greek haeresis sect school of belief were a problem to the church and the faith biblical lore acts one five recounts the convening of a council in jerusalem to deal with the heresy of the judaizers who had contended with the jerusalem faction in asia and especially galatia in the subsequent centuries there were the arians and manicheans in the middle ages there were the cathari and waldenses and in the renaissance there were the hussites lutherans calvinists and rosicrucians efforts to suppress heresies were initially ad hoc but in the middle ages a permanent structure came into being to combat heresies the church deemed it according to the public good to remove these heretics from the public or at least to correct them as the church held that the eternal good of one s soul depends on it s adherence to the teachings of the magisterium of the church although it was originally the state who began the reprimanding of heretics it eventually fell in the hands of the church in the late middle ages history there were four inquisitions in chronological order they were the medieval inquisition the spanish inquisition the portuguese inquisition and the roman inquisition one would however be incorrect to presume that these were totally unrelated to each other and that the inquisition was limited to these discrete events medieval inquisition main article medieval inquisition the first of the medieval inquisitions is called the episcopal inquisition and was established in the year one one eight four by a papal bull an official letter from the pope entitled ad abolendam for the purpose of doing away with the inquisition was in response to the growing catharist heresy in southern france it is called the episcopal because it was administered by local bishops which in greek is episcopos the episcopal inquisition was not very effective for many reasons see medieval inquisition the papal inquisition in the one two three zero s was in response to the failures of the episcopal inquisition and was staffed by professionals trained specifically for the job as decreed by the pope individuals were chosen from different orders and secular clergy but primarily they came from the dominican order who had a number of traits that made them suitable see medieval inquisition spanish inquisition main article spanish inquisition the spanish inquisition was founded in one four seven eight in spain under ferdinand and isabella of castile it was to a large extent under the control of the spanish monarch with only the inquisitor general appointed by rome in its dealings with converted muslims and jews and also illuminists the spanish inquisition with its auto de fe represents a particularly notorious period in the history of the inquisition this inquisition also gave rise to the peruvian inquisition during the viceroyalty of peru which ended with its independence on july two eight and also the mexican inquisition which continued in the americas until mexican independence it was abolished in one eight three four roman inquisition main article roman inquisition pope paul iii established in one five four two a permanent congregation staffed with cardinals and other officials whose task it was to maintain and defend the integrity of the faith and to examine and proscribe errors and false doctrines this body the congregation of the holy office now called the congregation for the doctrine of the faith part of the roman curia became the supervisory body of local inquisitions the pope appoints one of the cardinals to preside over the meetings there are usually ten other cardinals on the congregation as well as a prelate and two assistants all chosen from the dominican order the holy office also has an international group of consultants experienced scholars of theology and canon law who advise it on specific questions in one six one six these consultants gave their assessment of the propositions that the sun is immobile and at the center of the universe and that the earth moves around it judging both to be foolish and absurd in philosophy and the first to be formally heretical and the second at least erroneous in faith in theology this assessment led to copernicus s de revolutionibus orbium coelestium to be placed on the index of forbidden books until revised and galileo galilei to be admonished about his copernicanism it was this same body in one six three three that tried galileo condemned him for a grave suspicion of heresy and banned all his works not all prosecutions of alleged heretics atheists and other deviations from the catholic faith were prosecuted by the inquisition in some countries such as france under the ancien r gime atheists and blasphemers could be prosecuted by civilian courts with the possible penalty of death portuguese inquisition main article portuguese inquisition the portuguese inquisition was established in portugal in one five three six by the king of portugal joao iii as a portuguese analogue of the more famous spanish inquisition other uses of the word inquisitions even though the last inquisition the spanish inquisition ended in one eight three four almost two zero zero years ago the word inquisition remains a part of modern vocabulary even those with no interest in european history associate it with negative meanings because of the negative images associated with the inquisition the term has taken on a pejorative usage and is often used to express disapproval and is often used in a non neutral manner and not as a neutral historical descriptor some christian fundamentalist authors like jack chick and alberto rivera along with other like minded authors believe the nazi holocaust was an inquisition against the jews undertaken by hitler a catholic at the behest of the pope in modern american politics united states

religious beliefs associating apostasy with a failure to observe traditional customs and suggesting the requirements for conversion to judaism included circumcision and adherence to traditional customs notably in orthodox judaism some principles of faith e g the divine origin of the torah are considered important enough that public rejection of them can put one in the category of apikoros heretic over the centuries a number of clear formulations of jewish principles of faith have appeared many with common elements and though they differ with respect to certain details they demonstrate a wide variety of tolerance for varying theological perspectives of these the one most widely considered authoritative is maimonides thirteen principles of faith god is one strict unitarian monotheism in which the eternal creator of the universe is the source of morality god is all powerful omnipotent as well as all knowing omniscient and the different names of god are ways to express different aspects of god s presence in the world see also names of god in judaism god is non physical non corporeal and eternal all statements in the hebrew bible and in rabbinic literature which use anthropomorphism are held to be linguistic conceits or metaphors as it would otherwise be impossible to talk about god one may offer prayer to god alone any belief in an intermediary between man and god either necessary or optional has traditionally been considered heretical the hebrew bible and much of the beliefs described in the mishnah and talmud are held to be the product of divine revelation how revelation works and what precisely one means when one says that a book is divine has always been a matter of some dispute different understandings of this subject exist among jews the words of the prophets are true moses was the chief of all prophets the torah five books of moses is the primary text of judaism god will reward those who observe his commandments and punish those who violate them god chose the jewish people to be in a unique covenant with him see also jews as a chosen people there will be a moshiach jewish messiah or perhaps a messianic era the soul is pure at birth and human beings have free will with an innate yetzer ha tov a tendency to do good and a yetzer ha ra a tendency to do bad people can atone for sins through words and deeds without intermediaries through prayer repentance and tzedakah dutiful giving of charity if accompanied by a sincere decision to cease unacceptable actions and if appropriate amends to others are honestly undertaken always providing a way back to god see also jewish views of sin the traditional jewish bookshelf a torah scroll the torah contains the five books of moses which are the first five books of the hebrew bible jews are often called a people of the book and judaism has an age old intellectual tradition focusing on text based torah study the following is a basic structured list of the central works of jewish practice and thought for more detail see rabbinic literature the tanakh hebrew bible and jewish bible study which include mesorah targum jewish biblical exegesis also see midrash below

traditional jewish bookshelf list of jewish prayers and blessings jewish law and interpretation the basis of jewish law and tradition halakha is the torah the five books of moses according to rabbinic tradition there are six one three commandments in the torah some of these laws are directed only to men or to women some only to the ancient priestly groups the kohanim and leviyim members of the tribe of levi some only to those who practice farming within the land of israel many laws were only applicable when the temple in jerusalem existed and fewer than three zero zero of these commandments are still applicable today while there have been jewish groups which claimed to be based on the written text of the torah alone e g the sadducees and the karaites most jews believed in what they call the oral law these oral traditions were transmitted by the pharisee sect of ancient judaism and were later recorded in written form and expanded upon by the rabbis rabbinic judaism has always held that the books of the tanakh called the written law have always been transmitted in parallel with an oral tradition to justify this viewpoint jews point to the text of the torah where many words are left undefined and many procedures mentioned without explanation or instructions this they argue means that the reader is assumed to be familiar with the details from other i e oral sources this parallel set of material was originally transmitted orally and came to be known as the oral law by the time of rabbi judah ha nasi two zero zero ce after the destruction of jerusalem much of this material was edited together into the mishnah over the next four centuries this law underwent discussion and debate in both of the world s major jewish communities in israel and babylonia and the commentaries on the mishnah from each of these communities eventually came to be edited together into compilations known as the two talmuds these have been expounded by commentaries of various torah scholars during the ages halakha the rabbinic jewish way of life then is based on a combined reading of the torah and the oral tradition the mishnah the halakhic midrash the talmud and its commentaries the halakha has developed slowly through a precedent based system the literature of questions to rabbis and their considered answers is referred to as responsa in hebrew sheelot u teshuvot over time as practices develop codes of jewish law are written that are based on the responsa the most important code the shulkhan arukh largely determines jewish religious practice up to today what makes a person jewish according to jewish law someone is considered to be a jew if he or she was born of a jewish mother or converted in accord with jewish law recently the american reform and reconstructionist movements have included those born of jewish fathers and gentile mothers if the children are raised practicing judaism only all mainstream forms of judaism today are open to sincere converts a jew who ceases to practice judaism is still considered a jew as is a jew who does not accept jewish principles of faith and becomes an agnostic or an atheist so too with a jew who converts to another religion however in the latter case the person loses standing as a member of the jewish community and becomes known as an apostate in the past family and friends were said often to formally mourn for the person though this is rarely done today the question of what determines jewish identity was given new impetus when in the one nine five zero s david ben gurion requested opinions on mihu yehudi who is a jew from jewish religious authorities and intellectuals worldwide the question is far from settled and occasionally resurfaces in israeli politics jewish philosophy jewish philosophy refers to the conjunction between serious study of philosophy and jewish theology major jewish philosophers include solomon ibn gabirol saadia gaon maimonides and gersonides major changes occurred in response to the enlightenment late one seven zero zero s to early one eight zero zero s leading to the post enlightenment jewish philosophers and then modern jewish philosophers such as martin buber franz rosenzweig mordecai kaplan abraham joshua heschel will herberg emmanuel levinas richard rubenstein emil fackenheim and joseph soloveitchik jewish denominations over the past two centuries the jewish community has divided into a number of jewish denominations each has a different understanding of what principles of belief a jew should hold and how one should live as a jew to some degree these doctrinal differences have created schisms between the jewish denominations nonetheless there is some level of jewish unity for example it would not be unusual for a conservative jew to attend either an orthodox or reform synagogue the article on relationships between jewish religious movements discusses how different jewish denominations view each other orthodox judaism holds that the torah was written by god and dictated to moses and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging orthodox jews generally consider the shulkhan arukh to be the definitive codification of jewish law and assert a continuity between pre enlightenment judaism and modern day orthodox judaism most of orthodox judaism holds to one particular form of jewish theology based on maimonides one three principles of jewish faith orthodox judaism broadly and informally shades into two main styles modern orthodox judaism and haredi judaism the philosophical distinction is generally around accommodation to modernity and weight placed on non jewish disciplines though in practical terms the differences are often reflected in styles of dress and rigor in practice modern orthodox is a common traditional form of judaism which has a broad respect for historic traditions and practices and worship and belief in traditional form traditional orthodox or haredi judaism is a very conservative form of judaism it is sometimes called ultra orthodox judaism but this term is widely considered to be offensive though there are a number of haredi jewish groups who like modern orthodoxy accept modernization most notibly lubavitch hassidism the modern culture is seen as a means to worship god instead of an end unto itself hasidic judaism is a sub set of haredi judaism hasidic jews are one part of the haredi community the most theologically conservative form of judaism conservative judaism known as masorti judaism outside of the united states developed in europe and the united states in the one eight zero zero s as jews reacted to the changes brought about by the enlightenment and jewish emancipation it is characterized by a commitment to following traditional jewish laws and customs including observance of shabbat and kashrut a deliberately non fundamentalist teaching of jewish principles of faith a positive attitude toward modern culture an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic modes of study and modern scholarship and critical text study when considering jewish religious texts it teaches that jewish law was not static but rather has always developed in response to changing conditions it holds that the torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by god but rejects the orthodox position that it was dictated by god to moses similarly conservative judaism holds that judaism s oral law is divine and normative but rejects some orthodox interpretations of the oral law progressive judaism is composed of multiple movements in several countries reform judaism called liberal or progressive in many countries originally formed in germany in response to the enlightenment note that in the united kingdom there are two distinct congregational unions reform and liberal the former is significantly more traditional than the latter but both hold to essentially the same theoretical position its defining characteristic with respect to the other movements is its rejection of the binding nature of jewish law as such and instead believing that individual jews should exercise an informed autonomy about what to observe reform judaism initially defined judaism as a religion rather than as a race or culture rejected the ritual prescriptions and proscriptions of the torah and emphasized the ethical call of the prophets reform judaism developed a prayer service in the vernacular and emphasized personal connection to jewish tradition over specific forms of observance today many reform congregations have returned to hebrew prayers and encourage some degree of legal observance in reform judaism prayer is often conducted in the vernacular and men and women have equal roles in religious observance reconstructionist judaism started as a stream of philosophy by mordechai kaplan a conservative rabbi and later became an independent movement emphasizing reinterpreting judaism for modern times like reform judaism reconstructionist judaism does hold not that jewish law as such requires observance but unlike reform reconstructionist thought emphasises the role of the community in deciding what observances to follow humanistic judaism a small nontheistic movement that emphasizes jewish culture and history as the sources of jewish identity founded by rabbi sherwin wine it is centered in north america but has adherents in europe latin america and israel nota bene since humanistic judaism rejects the supernaturalistic monotheism that is seen as the essence of judaism by some other movements its inclusion as a jewish denomination is controversial many religious jews do not look at one s denomination as a valid way of designating jews instead they view jews by the level of their religious observance according to most orthodox jews jewish people who do not keep the laws of shabbat and yom tov the holidays kashrut and family purity are considered non religious any jew who keeps at least those laws would be considered observant and religious jewish denominations in israel even though all of these denominations exist in israel israelis tend to classify jewish identity in ways that are different than diaspora jewry most jewish israelis classify themselves as secular hiloni traditional masorti religious dati or haredi the term secular is more popular as a self description among israeli families of western european origin whose jewish identity may be a very powerful force in their lives but who see it as largely independent of traditional religious belief and practice this portion of the population largely ignores organized religious life be it of the official israeli rabbinate orthodox or of the liberal movements common to diaspora judaism reform conservative the term traditional masorti is most common as a self description among israeli families of eastern origin i e the middle east central asia and north africa this term as commonly used has nothing to do with the official masorti conservative movement there is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways secular and traditional are used in israel they often overlap and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of ideology and religious observance the term orthodox ortodoxi is unpopular in israeli discourse among both secular and religious alike nevertheless the spectrum covered by orthodox in the diaspora exists in israel again with some important variations the orthodox spectrum in israel is a far greater percentage of the jewish population in israel than in the diaspora though how much greater is hotly debated various ways of measuring this percentage each with its pros and cons include the proportion of religiously observant knesset members the proportion of jewish children enrolled in religious schools and statistical studies on identity what would be called orthodox in the diaspora includes what is commonly called dati religious or haredi ultra orthodox in israel the former term includes what is called religious zionism or the national religious community as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as haredi leumi nationalist haredi or hardal which combines a largely haredi lifestyle with nationalist ideology haredi applies to a populace that can be roughly divided into three separate groups along both ethnic and ideological lines one lithuanian non hasidic haredim of ashkenazic origin two hasidic haredim of ashkenazic origin and three sephardic haredim the third group is the largest and has been the most politically active since the early one nine nine zero s karaism unlike the above denominations which were ideological reactions that resulted from the exposure of traditional rabbinic judaism to the radical changes of modern times karaite judaism did not begin as a modern jewish movement the followers of karaism believe they are the remnants of the non rabbinic jewish sects of the second temple period such as the saducees though others contend they are a sect started in the eight th and nine th centuries the karaites or scripturalists accept only the hebrew bible and what they view as the peshat plain or simple meaning and do not accept non biblical writings as authoritative some european karaites do not see themselves as part of the jewish community while most do it is interesting to note that the nazis often did not associate karaites with jews and therefore several karaite communities were spared in wwii and exist to this day even in places such as lithuania where jewish communities were completely devastated in other areas such as greece the nazis deemed karaites as belonging to a greater jewish tradition and abused them accordingly the main article jewish views of religious pluralism describes how judaism views other religions it also describes how members of each of the jewish religious denominations view the other denominations jewish prayer and practice prayers a yemeni jew wearing a kippah skullcap prays with a tallit shawl the prayer box strapped to his forehead and arm are tefillin his uncut sidecurls are payot there are three main daily prayer services named shacharit mincha literally flour offering and maariv or arvit all services include a number of benedictions called the amidah or the shemonah esrei eighteen which on weekdays consists of nineteen blessings one was added in the time of the mishna but the name remains another key prayer in many services is the declaration of faith the shema which is recited at shacharit and maariv the shema states shema yisrael adonai eloheinu adonai echad or hear o israel the lord is our god the lord is one most of the prayers in a traditional jewish service can be said in solitary prayer however in order to have an actual service you are required to have ten people this is called a minyan prayer quorum there are also prayers and benedictions recited throughout the day such as those before eating the hamotzi or drinking kiddush there are a number of common jewish religious objects used in prayer the tallit is a jewish prayer shawl a kippah or yarmulke pronounced ya ma ka skullcap is a head covering worn during prayer by most jews and at all times by more orthodox jews especially ashkenazim phylacteries or tefillin boxes containing the portions of the torah mandating them are also worn by religious jews during weekday morning services the jewish approach to prayer differs among the various branches of judaism while all use the same set of prayers and texts the frequency of prayer the number of prayers recited at various religious events and whether one prays in a particular liturgical language or the vernacular differs from denomination to denomination with conservative and orthodox congregations using more traditional services and reform and reconstructionist synagogues more likely to incorporate translations contemporary writings and abbreviated services jewish holidays on yom kippur according to some the most important jewish holy day jews fast and pray in atonement for their sins communal as well as individual from an one eight seven eight painting jewish holy days celebrate central themes in the relationship between god and the world such as creation revelation and redemption shabbat shabbat the weekly day of rest lasting from shortly before sundown on friday night to shortly after sundown saturday night commemorates god s day of rest upon the completion of creation as well as the exodus from egypt it plays an important role in jewish practice and is the subject of a large body of religious law at the beginning of shabbat it is usual for the woman of the house to light a pair of candles and say a blessing praising god the evening meal begins with a sanctification of shabbat made over a cup of wine and a blessing said over two loaves of bread during shabbat jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under three nine categories of work for example writing carrying items in public and lighting fires are considered to be work driving is traditionally forbidden so many jews walk to synagogue to participate in shabbat services haggim haggim festivals celebrate revelation by commemorating different events in the passage of the children of israel out of slavery in egypt to their return to the land of canaan they are also timed to coincide with important agricultural seasons they are also pilgrimage holidays for which the children of israel would journey to jerusalem to offer sacrifices to god in his temple pesach or passover is a week long

transition from the barley harvest to the wheat harvest sukkot or the festival of booths commemorates the wandering of the children of israel through the desert it is celebrated through the construction of temporary booths called sukkahs that represent the temporary shelters of the children of israel during their wandering it coincides with the fruit harvest and marks the end of the agricultural cycle during sukkot jews are commanded to create their own sukkah a simple hut they decorate it with fruit and vegetables the roof is made of pine tree branches so that you can see the

head of the year it falls on the first day of the seventh month of the hebrew calendar tishri it is called the jewish new year because it celebrates the day that the world was created it also marks the beginning of the atonement period that ends ten days later with yom kippur during these ten days one must apologize to everyone whom one has wronged and they must forgive yom kippur or the day of atonement is a holiday centered on redemption a day of atonement and fasting for sins committed individually and communally during the previous year many consider this the most important jewish holiday yom kippur is both a solemn day marked by self scrutiny when jews should afflict themselves by fasting and a celebratory day as jews reflect on god s mercy minor holidays there are many minor holidays as well including purim which celebrates the events told in the biblical book of esther and hanukkah which is not established in the bible but which celebrates the successful rebellion by the maccabees against the seleucid empire torah readings the core of festival and sabbath prayer services is the public reading of the torah along with connected readings from the other books of the jewish bible called haftarah during the course of a year the full torah is read and the cycle begins again every autumn during simhat torah rejoicing in the torah synagogues and jewish buildings interior of the esnoga synagogue in amsterdam the teb h reader s platform in the foreground and the hekh l ark is in the background synagogues are a jewish houses of prayer and study they usually contain separate rooms for prayer the main sanctuary smaller rooms for study and often an area for community or educational use there is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly so a synagogue may contain any or none of these features an ark called aron ha kodesh by ashkenazim and hekhal by sephardim where the torah scrolls are kept the ark is often closed with an ornate curtain parokhet outside or inside the ark doors a large elevated reader s platform called bimah by ashkenazim and tebah by sephardim where the torah is read and from where the services are conducted in sephardi synagogues an eternal light ner tamid a continually lit lamp or lantern used as a reminder of the constantly lit menorah of the temple in jerusalem and mainly in ashkenazi synagogues a pulpit facing the congregation to preach from and a pulpit or amud hebrew for post or column facing the ark for the hazzan reader to lead the prayers from in addition to synagogues other buildings of signficance in judaism include yeshivas or institutions of jewish learning and mikvahs which are ritual baths dietary laws kashrut the laws of kashrut keeping kosher are the jewish dietary laws food in accord with jewish law is termed kosher and food not in accord with jewish law is termed treifah or treif from the context of the laws in the book of leviticus the purpose of kashrut is related to ritual purity and holiness as well as health kashrut involves the abstention from consuming animals that eat other animals and that roam the sea floor eating the excretions of other animals therefore excluding birds beasts of prey and seafood other than fish respectively also mixing meat and milk is not allowed as this is viewed as cooking the child in its mother s milk although sometimes rationalized by reference to hygiene its stated purpose is perhaps better understood as providing certainty that food eaten is prepared and partaken only from sources which are confirmed to have been spiritually appropriate and which avoided spiritual negatives such as pain sickness unclean animals or abusive practices in its preparation family purity the laws of niddah menstruant often referred to euphemistically as family purity and various other laws regulating the interaction between men and women e g tzeniut modesty in dress are perceived especially by orthodox jews as vital factors in jewish life though they are rarely followed by reform or conservative jews the laws of niddah dictate that sexual intercourse cannot take place while the woman is having a menstrual flow and she has to count seven clean days and immerse in a mikvah ritual bath following menstruation life cycle events life cycle events occur throughout a jew s life

time specialists required for religious services technically the last time judaism had a clergy was prior to the destruction of the second temple in seven zero ce when priests attended to the temple and sacrifices the priesthood is an inherited position and although priests no longer have clerical duties they are still honored in many jewish communities kohen priest patrilineal descendant of aaron brother of moses in the temple the kohanim were charged with performing the sacrifices today a kohen is the first one called up at the reading of the torah performs the priestly blessing as well as complying with other unique laws and ceremonies including the ceremony of redemption of the first born levi levite patrilineal descendant of levi the son of jacob today a levite is called up second to the reading of the torah levites also have a number of other minor duties in traditional synagogues including washing the hands of the kohanim priests before they say the priestly blessing prayer leaders from the times of the mishna and talmud to the present judaism has required specialists or authorities for the practice of very few rituals or ceremonies a jew can fulfil most requirements for prayer by himself some activities reading the torah and haftarah a supplementary portion from the prophets or writings the prayer for mourners the blessings for bridegroom and bride the complete grace after meals require a minyan the presence of ten adults orthodox jews and some conservative jews require ten adult men some conservative jews and reform jews include women in the minyan the most common professional clergy in a synagogue are rabbi of a congregation jewish scholar who is charged with answering the legal questions of a congregation orthodox judaism requires semicha rabbinical ordination a congregation does not necessarily require a rabbi some congregations have a rabbi but also allow members of the congregation to act as shatz or baal koreh see below hassidic rebbe rabbi who is the head of a hassidic dynasty note the ch denotes voiceless pharyngeal fricative cantor a trained vocalist who acts as shatz chosen for a good voice knowledge of traditional tunes understanding of the meaning of the prayers and sincerity in reciting them a congregation does not need to have a dedicated hazzan jewish prayer services do involve two specified roles which are sometimes but not always filled by a rabbi and or hazzan in many congregations shaliach tzibur or shatz leader literally agent or representative of the congregation leads those assembled in prayer and sometimes prays on behalf of the community when a shatz recites a prayer on behalf of the congregation he is not acting as an intermediary but rather as a facilitator the entire congregation participates in the recital of such prayers by saying amen at their conclusion it is with this act that the shatz s prayer becomes the prayer of the congregation any adult capable of speaking hebrew clearly may act as shatz orthodox jews and some conservative jews allow only men to act as shatz some conservative jews and reform jews allow women to act as shatz as well baal koreh master of the reading reads the weekly torah portion the requirements for acting as baal koreh are the same as those for the shatz note that these roles are not mutually exclusive the same person is often qualified to fill more than one role and often does often there are several people capable of filling these roles and different services or parts of services will be led by each many congregations especially larger ones also rely on a gabbai sexton calls people up to the torah appoints the shatz for each prayer session if there is no standard shatz and makes certain that the synagogue is kept clean and supplied the three preceding positions are usually voluntary and considered an honor since the enlightenment large synagogues have often adopted the practice of hiring rabbis and hazzans to act as shatz and baal koreh and this is still typically the case in most conservative and reform congregations however in most orthodox synagogues these positions are filled by laypeople specialized

topic this section will cover the elements of jewish history of most importance to the jewish religion and the development of jewish denominations ancient jewish religious history model of the temple in jerusalem jews trace their religious lineage to the biblical patriarch abraham through isaac and jacob after the exodus from egypt the jews came to canaan and settled the land a kingdom was established under saul and continued under king david and solomon with its capital in jerusalem after solomon s reign the nation split into two kingdoms the kingdom of israel in the north and the kingdom of judah in the south the kingdom of israel was conquered by the assyrian ruler shalmaneser v in the eight th century bce and spread all over the assyrian empire where they were assimilated into other cultures and become known as the ten lost tribes the kingdom of judah continued as an independent state until it was conquered by a babylonian army in the early six th century bce destroying the first temple that was at the centre of ancient jewish worship the judean elite was exiled to babylonia but later at least some of them returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of babylonia by the persians seventy years later a period known as the babylonian captivity a new second temple was constructed and old religious practices were resumed during the early years of the second temple the highest religious authority was a council known as the great assembly led by ezra of the book of ezra among other accomplishments of the great assembly the last books of the bible were written at this time after a jewish revolt against roman rule in six six ce the romans all but destroyed jerusalem only a single western wall of the second temple remained following a second revolt jews were not allowed to enter the city of jerusalem and most jewish worship was forbidden by rome following the destruction of jerusalem and the expulsion of the jews jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the temple and instead was rebuilt around rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities see jewish diaspora historical jewish groupings to one seven zero zero around the first century ce there were several small jewish sects the pharisees sadducees zealots essenes and christians after the destruction of the second temple in seven zero ce these sects vanished christianity survived but by breaking with judaism and becoming a separate religion the pharisees survived but in the form of rabbinic judaism today known simply as judaism the sadducees rejected the divine inspiration of the prophets and the writings relying only on the torah as divinely inspired consequently a number of other core tenets of the pharisees belief system which became the basis for modern judaism were also dismissed by the sadducees like the sadducees who relied only on the torah some jews in the eight th and nine th centuries rejected the authority and divine inspiration of the oral law of the pharisees rabbis as recorded in the mishnah and developed by later rabbis in the two talmuds relying instead only upon the tanakh these included the isunians the yudganites the malikites and others they soon developed oral traditions of their own which differed from the rabbinic traditions and eventually formed the karaite sect karaites exist in small numbers today mostly living in israel rabbinical and karaite jews each hold that the others are jews but that the other faith is erroneous over time jews developed into distinct ethnic groups amongst others the ashkenazi jews of central and eastern europe with russia the sephardi jews of spain portugal and north africa and the yemenite jews from the southern tip of the arabian peninsula this split is cultural and is not based on any doctrinal dispute although the distance did result in minor differences in practice and prayers persecutions anti semitism arose during the middle ages in the form of persecutions pogroms forced conversion social restrictions and ghettoization this was different in quality to any repressions of jews in ancient times ancient repression was politically motivated and jews were treated no differently than any other ethnic group would have been with the rise of the churches attacks on jews became motivated instead by theological considerations specifically deriving from christian views about jews and judaism hasidism hasidic judaism was founded by israel ben eliezer one seven zero zero one seven six zero also known as the ba al shem tov or besht it originated in a time of persecution of the jewish people when european jews had turned inward to talmud study many felt that most expressions of jewish life had become too academic and that they no longer had any emphasis on spirituality or joy his disciples attracted many followers they themselves established numerous hasidic sects across europe hasidic judaism eventually became the way of life for many jews in europe waves of jewish immigration in the one eight eight zero s carried it to the united states early on there was a serious schism between hasidic and non hasidic jews european jews who rejected the hasidic movement were dubbed by the hasidim as mitnagdim lit opponents some of the reasons for the rejection of hasidic judaism were the overwhelming exuberance of hasidic worship their untraditional ascriptions of infallibility and alleged miracle working to their leaders and the concern that it might become a messianic sect since then all the sects of hasidic judaism have been subsumed into mainstream orthodox judaism particularly haredi judaism the enlightenment and reform judaism in the late one eight th century ce europe was swept by a group of intellectual social and political movements known as the enlightenment the enlightenment led to reductions in the european laws that prohibited jews to interact with the wider secular world thus allowing jews access to secular education and experience a parallel jewish movement haskalah or the jewish enlightenment began especially in central europe in response to both the enlightenment and these new freedoms it placed an emphasis on integration with secular society and a pursuit of non religious knowledge the thrust and counter thrust between supporters of haskalah and more traditional jewish concepts eventually led to the formation of a number of different branches of judaism haskalah supporters founded reform judaism and liberal judaism while traditionalists founded many forms of orthodox judaism and jews seeking a balance between the two sides founded conservative judaism a number of smaller groups came into being as well the holocaust while the holocaust the genocide of millions of jews under nazi germany in world war ii did not directly affect jewish denominations the great loss of life it caused resulted in a radical demographic shift ultimately transforming the makeup of organized judaism into the way it is today a jewish day of mourning yom hashoah was inserted into the hebrew calendar commemorating the holocaust the present situation in most western nations such as the united states of america israel canada united kingdom argentina and south africa a wide variety of jewish practices exist along with a growing plurality of secular and non practicing jews for example in the world s largest jewish community the united states according to the two zero zero one national jewish population survey four three million out of five one million jews had some sort of connection to the religion of that population of connected jews eight zero participated in some sort of jewish religious observance but only four eight belonged to a synagogue religious and secular jewish movements in the usa and canada perceive this as a crisis situation and have grave concern over rising rates of intermarriage and assimilation in the jewish community since american jews are marrying at a later time in their life than they used to and are having fewer children than they used to the birth rate for american jews has dropped from over two zero down to one seven the replacement rate is two one this is my beloved this is my friend a rabbinic letter on intimate relations p two seven elliot n dorff the rabbinical assembly one nine nine six intermarriage rates range from four zero five zero in the us and only about a third of children of intermarried couples are raised jewish due to intermarriage and low birth rates the jewish population in the us shrank from five five million in one nine nine zero to five one million in two zero zero one this is indicative of the general population trends among the jewish community in the diaspora but a focus on population masks the diversity of current jewish religious practice as well as growth trends among some communities like haredi jews in the last five zero years there has been a general increase in interest in religion among many segments of the jewish population all of the major jewish denominations have experienced a resurgence in popularity with increasing numbers of younger jews participating in jewish education joining synagogues and becoming to varying degrees more observant complementing the increased popularity of the major denominations has been a number of new approaches to jewish worship including feminist approaches to judaism and jewish renewal movements there is a separate article on the baal teshuva movement the movement of jews returning to observant judaism though this gain has not offset the general demographic loss due to intermarriage and acculturation many jewish communities and movements are growing judaism and other religions christianity and judaism since the holocaust there has been much to note in the way of reconciliation between some christian groups and the jewish people the article on christian jewish reconciliation studies this issue messianic judaism sometimes hebrew christianity is the common designation for a number of christian groups which include varying degrees of jewish practice these groups have attracted tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands of jews and christians to their ranks members identify themselves as jews these groups are viewed highly negatively by all jewish denominations which typically see them as covert and deceptive attempts to convert jews to christianity a view messianic jewish groups strongly contest mormonism and judaism if a member of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints has an established jewish heritage and lineage then they are considered by the mormons to be of the tribe of judah and as such considered both mormon and jewish by mormon authorities islam and judaism under islamic rule judaism has been practiced for almost one five zero zero years and this has led to an interplay between the two religions which has been positive as well as negative at times the period around nine zero zero to one two zero zero in moorish spain came to be known as the golden age of jewish culture in spain the two zero th century animosity of muslim leaders towards zionism the

philosopher and political economist was an influential classical liberal thinker of the one nine th century he was an advocate of utilitarianism the ethical theory first proposed by his godfather jeremy bentham biography john stuart mill was born in pentonville london the oldest son of the scottish philosopher and historian james mill john stuart was educated by his father with the advice and assistance of jeremy bentham and francis place he was given an extremely rigorous upbringing and was deliberately shielded from association with children his own age other than his siblings his father a follower of bentham and an adherent of associationism had as his explicit aim to create a genius intellect that would carry on the cause of utilitarianism and its implementation after he and bentham were dead his feats as a child were exceptional at the age of three he was taught the greek alphabet and long lists of greek words with their english equivalents by the age of eight he had read aesop s fables xenophon s anabasis and the whole of herodotus and was acquainted with lucian diogenes la rtius isocrates and six dialogues of plato see his autobiography he had also read a great deal of history in english and had been taught arithmetic a contemporary record of mill s studies from eight to thirteen is published in bain s sketch of his life it suggests that his autobiography rather understates the amount of work done at the age of eight he began learning latin euclid and algebra and was appointed schoolmaster to the younger children of the family his main reading was still history but he went through all the latin and greek authors commonly read in the schools and universities at the time he was not taught to compose either in latin or in greek and he was never an exact scholar it was for the subject matter that he was required to read and by the age of ten he could read plato and demosthenes with ease his father s history of india was published in one eight one eight immediately thereafter about the age of twelve john began a thorough study of the scholastic logic at the same time reading aristotle s logical treatises in the original language in the following year he was introduced to political economy and studied adam smith and david ricardo with his father ultimately completing their classical economic view of factors of production in one eight two three he co founded the westminster review with jeremy bentham as a journal for philosophical radicals this intensive study however had injurious effects on mill s mental health and state of mind at the age of two one he suffered a nervous breakdown as explained in chapter v of his autobiography this was caused by the great physical and mental arduousness of his studies which had suppressed any feelings or spirituality he might have developed normally in childhood nevertheless this depression eventually began to dissipate as he began to find solace in the poetry of william wordsworth his capacity for emotion resurfaced mill remarking that the cloud gradually drew off mill was offered a place to study at cambridge university but instead followed his father to work for the british east india company and after the company was dissolved he was elected for a brief period as an independent member of parliament representing the city and westminster constituency from one eight six five to one eight six eight during his time as an mp mill advocated easing the burdens on ireland and became the first person in parliament to call for women to be given the right to vote in considerations on representative government mill called for various reforms of parliament and voting especially proportional representation the single transferable vote and the extension of suffrage he was godfather to bertrand russell harriet taylor in one eight five one mill married harriet taylor after two one years of an at times intense friendship and love affair taylor was a significant influence on mill s work and ideas during both friendship and marriage his relationship with harriet taylor reinforced mill s advocacy of women s rights he cites her influence in his final revision of on liberty which she died before being able to edit to completion and appears to be obliquely cited in the text of the subjection of women he died in avignon france in one eight seven three and is buried alongside his wife work one foundational book on the concept of liberty was on liberty about the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual one argument that mill developed further than any previous philosopher was the harm principle that is people should be free to engage in whatever behavior they wish as long as it does not harm others john stuart mill only speaks of negative liberty in on liberty a concept formed and named by isaiah berlin one nine zero nine one nine nine seven isaiah berlin suggests that negative liberty is an absence or lack of impediments obstacles or coercion this is in contrast with his other idea of positive liberty a capacity for behavior and the presence of conditions for freedom be they material resources a level of enlightenment or the opportunity for political participation thus mill argued that it is government s role only to remove the barriers such as laws to behaviours that do not harm others crucially he felt that offence did not constitute harm and therefore supported almost total freedom of speech only in cases where free speech would lead to direct harm did mill wish to limit it for example whipping up an angry mob to go and attack people would not be defended in mill s system mill argued that free discourse was vital to ensure progress he argued that we could never be sure if a silenced opinion did not hold some portion of the truth ingeniously he also argued that even false opinions have worth in that in refuting false opinions the holders of true opinions have their beliefs reaffirmed without having to defend one s beliefs mill argued the beliefs would become dead and we would forget why we held them at all he claimed this had happened to christianity another important work of mill s was utilitarianism which argues for the philosophy of utilitarianism this philosophy was primarily formed by jeremy bentham but mill s father james mill was also a proponent utilitarianism holds that actions are good in proportion to the amount of happiness produced and number of people happiness is produced in mill s main contribution to utilitarianism is the idea of a hierarchy of pleasures bentham had treated all forms of happiness as equal whereas mill argued that intellectual and moral pleasures and developments were superior to more physical forms of pleasure many have pointed out that the doctrine of the absolute right to liberty outlined in on liberty and the absolute pragmatism of utilitarianism are difficult to reconcile under strict utilitarianism for example freedom of speech ought to be violated if more happiness can be generated that way most attempts to unify these two aspects of mill s thought have relied on rule utilitarianism as that seems to be what mill had in mind when writing on liberty mill was economically mainly for laissez faire but he accepted interventions in the economy such as a tax on alcohol if there were sufficient utilitarian grounds mill s magnum opus was his a system of logic ratiocinative and inductive which went through several revisions and editions william whewell s history of the inductive sciences one eight three seven was a chief influence the reputation of this work is largely due to his analysis of inductive proof in contrast to aristotle s syllogisms which are deductive mill describes the five basic principles of induction which have come to be known as mill s methods the method of agreement the method of difference the joint or double method of agreement and difference the method of residues and that of concomitant variations the common feature of these methods the one real method of scientific inquiry is that of elimination all the other methods are thus subordinate to the method of difference it was also mill s attempt to postulate a theory of knowledge in the same vein as john locke mill is also famous for being one of the earliest and strongest male supporters of women s liberation his book the subjection of women is one of the earliest written on this subject by a male author he felt that the oppression of women was one of the few remaining relics from ancient times one which impeded the progress of humanity this was an issue he actively supported throughout his life writing many newspaper articles and delivering many speeches on it many cadets at the u s air force academy best remember him for the following quotation which is required memorization for all fourthclassmen war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and

philosophers feminists political philosophers utilitarians voting theorists junk or bunk science is a pejorative term used to derogate purportedly scientific data research analyses or claims which are perceived to be driven by political financial or other questionable motives it is these motives that distinguish junk science from pseudoscience and controversial science as with many other ideological terms there is often no political agreement as to which side of a debate constitutes junk and which real science though the scientific community may have an overwhelming majority opinion public debates on environmental and public health issues seem particularly prone to this problem these debates are further complicated when scientists use mass media to publicize their research use of the term john stauber and sheldon rampton of pr watch believe that the term junk science is often used to deride scientific findings which stand in the way of short term corporate profit maximization in their book trust us we re experts two zero zero one they write that industry has launched multi million dollar campaigns to position certain theories as junk science often failing to employ the scientific method themselves for example the tobacco industry has used the term junk science to describe research showing negative effects of smoking and second hand smoke through various astroturf groups more consonant theories may be praised using the term sound science another example for discrediting disliked scientific findings is a large industry campaign to reposition global warming as theory not fact that is described in detail by stauber and rampton anti global warming environmental scientists and spokespersons for corporations and government bureaucracies counter by saying that the scientific evidence used by their critics actually constitutes junk science and should not be used as a basis for policy in january two zero zero six paul d thacker of the new republic noted that

october two seven one seven two eight o s february one four one seven seven nine was an english explorer navigator and cartographer he made three voyages to the pacific ocean accurately charting many areas and recording several islands and coastlines on european maps for the first time his most notable accomplishments were the british discovery and claiming of the east coast of australia the european discovery of the hawaiian islands and the first circumnavigation and mapping of newfoundland and new zealand early life james cook was born in relatively humble circumstances at marton in north yorkshire near what is today recognised as the town of middlesbrough cook was one of five children born to a local woman and a scottish immigrant farm labourer grace and james sr as a child cook moved with his family to airey holme farm at great ayton where he was educated at the local school now a museum his studies financed by his father s employer at one three he began work with his father who managed the farm in one seven four five when he was one six cook left home to be apprenticed in a grocery haberdashery in the fishing village of staithes according to legend cook first felt the lure of the sea while gazing out the shop window after a year and a half in staithes the shop s owner mr anderson found james unsuited to the trade mr anderson took james to the nearby port town of whitby and introduced him to john and henry walker john and henry were prominent local ship owners and quakers and were in the coal trade business cook was taken on as a merchant navy apprentice in their small fleet of vessels plying coal along the english coast his first assignment was aboard the collier freelove and he spent several years on this and various other coasters sailing between the tyne and london for this new apprenticeship cook applied himself to the study of algebra trigonometry navigation and astronomy skills he would need one day to command his own ship his three year apprenticeship completed cook began working on trading ships in the baltic sea he soon progressed through the merchant navy ranks starting with his one seven five two promotion to mate officer in charge of navigation aboard the collier brig friendship in one seven five five he was offered command of this vessel but within the month he volunteered for service in the british royal navy in one seven five five the kingdom of great britain was re arming for what was to become the seven years war cook saw that his career could advance more quickly in military service however this required starting over in the naval hierarchy and on june one seven he began as able seaman aboard hms eagle under the command of captain hugh palliser he was very quickly promoted to master s mate family life cook married elizabeth batts the daughter of one of his mentors on december two one one seven six two the couple would eventually have six children james one seven six three one seven nine four nathaniel one seven six four one seven eight one elizabeth one seven six seven one seven seven one joseph one seven six eight one seven six eight george one seven seven two one seven seven two and hugh one seven seven six one seven nine three when not at sea james cook settled in the east end of london he attended st paul s church shadwell where his son james was baptised start of royal navy career james cook s one seven seven five chart of newfoundland during the seven years war he participated in the siege of quebec city before the battle of the plains of abraham in one seven five nine he showed a talent for surveying and cartography and was responsible for mapping much of the entrance to the saint lawrence river during the siege allowing general wolfe to make his famous stealth attack on the plains of abraham cook s surveying skills were put to good use in the one seven six zero s mapping the jagged coast of newfoundland cook surveyed the northwest stretch in one seven six three and one seven six four the south coast between the burin peninsula and cape ray in one seven six five and one seven six six and the west coast in one seven six seven cook s five seasons in newfoundland produced the first large scale and accurate maps of the island s coasts they also gave cook his mastery of practical surveying achieved under often adverse conditions and brought him to the attention of the admiralty and royal society at a crucial moment both in his personal career and in the direction of british overseas discovery cook s huge achievements can be attributed to a combination of excellent seamanship his superior surveying and cartographic skills courage in exploring dangerous locations to confirm the facts e g dipping into the antarctic circle repeatedly and exploring around the great barrier reef ability to lead men in adverse conditions and boldness both with regard to the extent of his explorations and his willingness to exceed the instructions given to him by the admiralty first voyage one seven six eight one seven seven one in one seven six six the royal society hired cook to travel to the pacific ocean to observe and record a transit of venus across the sun cook was commissioned as a lieutenant and given command of hm bark endeavour he sailed from england in one seven six eight rounded cape horn and continued westward across the pacific to arrive at tahiti on april one three one seven six nine where the observations were to be made the transit was scheduled to occur on june three and in the meantime he commissioned the building of a small fort and observatory the astronomer appointed to the task was charles green assistant to the recently appointed astronomer royal nevil maskelyne the primary purpose of the observation was to obtain measurements which could be used to more accurately calculate the distance of venus from the sun if this could be achieved then the distances of the other known planets could be worked out based on their relative orbits on the day of the transit observation cook recorded saturday three rd this day prov d as favourable to our purpose as we could wish not a clowd was to be seen the whole day and the air was perfectly clear so that we had every advantage we could desire in observing the whole of the passage of the planet venus over the suns disk we very distinctly saw an atmosphere or dusky shade round the body of the planet which very much disturbed the times of the contacts particularly the two internal ones d r solander observed as well as m r green and my self and we differ d from one another in observeing the times of the contacts much more than could be expected disappointingly the separate measurements of green cook and solander varied more than the anticipated margin of error their instrumentation was adequate by the standards of the time but the resolution still could not eliminate the errors when their results were later compared to those of the other observations of the same event made elsewhere for the exercise the net result was not as conclusive or accurate as had been hoped once the observations were completed cook then departed in order to execute the secondary purpose of his voyage namely to search the south pacific for signs of the postulated southern continent of terra australis the royal society and especially alexander dalrymple believed that it must exist however cook had his own personal doubts on the subject with the help of a tahitian named tupaia who had extensive knowledge of pacific geography cook managed to reach new zealand becoming only the second european in history to do so behind abel tasman over a century earlier in one six four two cook mapped the complete new zealand coastline making only some minor errors such as calling banks peninsula an island and thinking stewart island rakiura was part of the south island he also discovered cook strait which separates the north island from the south island and which tasman had not seen he then set course westwards intending to strike for van diemen s land present day tasmania earlier sighted by tasman in order to establish whether or not it formed part of the fabled southern continent however they were forced to maintain a more northerly course owing to prevailing gales and sailed onwards until one afternoon when land was sighted which cook named point hicks cook calculated that van diemen s land ought to lie due south of their position but having found the coastline trending to the southwest recorded his doubt that this landmass was connected to it this point was on the southeastern coast of the australian continent and in doing so his expedition became the first recorded europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline in his journal cook recorded the event thus the southermost point of land we had in sight which bore from us w one four s i judged to lay in the latitude of three eight zero s and in the longitude of two one one zero seven w t from the meridion of greenwich i have named it point hicks because leuit t hicks was the first who discover d this land the ship s log recorded the date as being thursday april one nine one seven seven zero however cook had not made the necessary adjustments when they had earlier crossed the one eight zero th meridian of longitude and the actual calendar date was friday april two zero the landmark of this sighting is generally reckoned to be a point lying about half way between the present day towns of orbost and mallacoota on the southeastern coast of the state of victoria a later survey done in one eight four three ignored or overlooked cook s earlier naming of the point giving it the name cape everard on the two zero zero th anniversary of the sighting the name was officially changed back to point hicks captain cook monument corner brook newfoundland the endeavour continued northwards along the coastline keeping the land in sight and cook charting and naming landmarks as he went a little over a week later they came across an extensive but shallow inlet and upon entering it moored off a low headland fronted by sand dunes it was here on april two nine that cook and crew made their first landfall on the continent at a place now known as kurnell at first cook bestowed the name stingaree stingray bay to the inlet after the many such creatures found there this was later changed to botanist bay and finally botany bay after the unique specimens retrieved by the botanists joseph banks daniel solander and herman sp ring this first landing site was later to be promoted particularly by joseph banks as a suitable candidate for situating a settlement and british colonial outpost however almost eighteen years after this first landing when captain arthur phillip and the first fleet arrived in early one seven eight eight to establish an outpost and penal colony they found that the bay and surrounds did not live up to the promising picture which had been painted instead phillip shortly thereafter gave orders to relocate to a harbour a few kilometres to the north which cook had named port jackson but had not further explored it was in this harbour at a place phillip named sydney cove that the settlement of sydney was established the settlement was for some time afterwards still referred to generally as botany bay the expedition s scientific members commenced the first european scientific documentation of australian fauna and flora at cook s original landing contact was made with the local australian aborigine inhabitants as the ships sailed into the harbour they noticed aborigines on both of the headlands at about two p m they put the anchor down near a group of six to eight huts two aborigines a younger and an older man came down to the boat they ignored gifts from cook a musket was fired over their heads which wounded the older man slightly and he ran towards the huts he came back with other men and threw spears at cook s men although they did no harm they were chased off after two more rounds were fired the adults had left but cook found several aboriginal children in the huts and left some beads with them as a gesture of friendship cook continued northwards charting along the coastline a mishap occurred when the endeavour ran aground on a shoal of the great barrier reef on june one one one seven seven zero the ship was seriously damaged and his voyage was delayed almost seven weeks while repairs were carried out on the beach near the docks of modern cooktown at the mouth of the endeavour river while there joseph banks herman sp ring and daniel solander made their first major collections of australian flora the crew s encounters with the local aboriginal people were mainly peaceable from the group encountered here the name kangaroo was to be entered into the english language coming from the local guugu yimidhirr name for a grey kangaroo which was gangaroo once repairs were complete the voyage continued eventually passing by the northern most point of cape york peninsula and then sailing through torres strait between australia and new guinea earlier navigated by luis vaez de torres in one six zero four at that point in the voyage cook had lost not a single man to scurvy a remarkable and practically unheard of achievement in one eight th century long distance sea faring adhering to royal navy policy introduced in one seven four seven cook forced his men to eat foods such as citrus fruits and sauerkraut at that time it was known that poor diet caused scurvy but not specifically that a vitamin c deficiency was the culprit cook sailed on for batavia the capital of the dutch east indies to put in for repairs batavia was known for its outbreaks of malaria and before they returned home in one seven seven one many in cook s crew would succumb to the disease and other ailments such as dysentery including the tahitian tupaia banks s finnish secretary and a fellow scientist herman sp ring astronomer charles green and the illustrator sydney parkinson cook had named the sp ring island on the coast of new zealand to honor herman sp ring and his work on the voyage the endeavour his ship on this first voyage would later lend its name to the space shuttle endeavour as well as the endeavour river cook s journals were published upon his return and he became something of a hero among the scientific community among the general public however the aristocratic botanist joseph banks was a bigger hero banks even attempted to take command of cook s second voyage but removed himself from the voyage before it began the south pacific routes of captain james cook s voyages the first voyage is shown in red second voyage in green third voyage in blue second voyage one seven seven two one seven seven five shortly after his return cook was promoted from lieutenant to commander correctly master and commander then once again he was commissioned by the royal society to search for the mythical terra australis on his first voyage cook had demonstrated by circumnavigating new zealand that it was not attached to a larger landmass to the south and although by charting almost the entire eastern coastline of australia he had shown it to be continental in size the terra australis being sought was supposed to lie further to the south despite this evidence to the contrary dalrymple and others of the royal society still believed that this massive southern continent should exist cook commanded hms resolution on this voyage while tobias furneaux commanded its companion ship hms adventure cook s expedition circumnavigated the globe at a very high southern latitude becoming one of the first to cross the antarctic circle on january one seven one seven seven three reaching seven one one zero south he also discovered south georgia and the south sandwich islands in the antarctic fog the resolution and adventure became separated furneaux made his way to new zealand where he lost some of his men following a fight with the m ori and eventually sailed back to britain while cook continued to explore the antarctic cook almost discovered the mainland of antarctica but turned back north towards tahiti to resupply his ship he then resumed his southward course in a second fruitless attempt to find the supposed continent on this leg of the voyage he brought with him a young tahitian named omai who proved to be somewhat less knowledgeable about the pacific than tupaia had been on the first voyage on his return voyage he landed at the friendly islands easter island and vanuatu in one seven seven four his reports upon his return home put to rest the popular myth of terra australis another accomplishment of the second voyage was the successful employment of the k one chronometer which facilitated accurate measurement of longitude upon his return cook was promoted to the naval rank of captain and given an honorary retirement from the royal navy as officer in the greenwich hospital but cook could not be kept away from the sea a third voyage was planned to find the northwest passage cook would travel to the pacific and hoped to travel east to the atlantic while a simultaneous voyage would travel the opposite way third voyage one seven seven six one seven seven nine on his last voyage cook once again commanded hms resolution while captain charles clerke commanded hms discovery ostensibly the voyage was planned to return omai to tahiti this is what the general public believed as he had become a favourite curiosity in london after returning omai cook travelled north and in one seven seven eight became the first european to visit the hawaiian islands which he named the sandwich islands after the four th earl of sandwich the acting first lord of the admiralty there is some discussion by recent historians that cook s arrival on what is now the big island of hawaii coincided by quirk of fate with a season of worship for the polynesian god lono indeed the form of cook s ship hms resolution more particularly the mast formation sails and rigging resembled certain significant artifacts that formed part of the season of worship similarly cook s anti clockwise route around the island before making landfall resembled the processions that took place in an anti clockwise direction around the island during the lono festivals for these reasons the arrival it is thought led to cook s and to a limited extent his crew s initial deification by the natives who treated him with great reverence as possibly an incarnation of lono himself from there he travelled east to explore the west coast of north america eventually landing near the first nations village at yuquot in nootka sound on vancouver island although he unknowingly sailed past the strait of juan de fuca he explored and mapped the coast from california all the way to the bering strait on the way discovering what came to be known as cook inlet in alaska the bering strait proved to be impassable although he made several attempts to sail through it cook became increasingly frustrated on this voyage and probably began to suffer from a stomach ailment it is speculated that this led to irrational behaviour towards his crew such as forcing them to eat walrus meat which they found inedible cook returned to hawaii in one seven seven nine on february one four at kealakekua bay some hawaiians stole one of cook s small boats normally as thefts were quite common in tahiti and the other islands he would have taken hostages until the stolen articles were returned indeed he planned to take hostage the chief of hawaii kalaniopu u however his stomach ailment and increasingly irrational behaviour led to an altercation with a large crowd of hawaiians gathered on the beach in the ensuing skirmish shots were fired at the hawaiians and cook was clubbed and stabbed to death it is thought that cook s return to hawaii outside the season of worship for lono makahiki which was synonymous with peace and thus in the season of war k may have upset the equilibrium and fostered an atmosphere of resentment and aggression from the local population coupled with a jaded grasp of native diplomacy and a burgeoning but limited understanding of local politics cook may have inadvertently contributed to the tensions that ultimately conspired in his demise the esteem in which the captain was nevertheless held by the natives resulted in his body being retained by their chiefs and elders possibly for partial human consumption though this assertion remains contentious and the flesh cut and roasted from his bones indeed some of cook s remains disclosing some corroborating evidence to this effect were eventually returned to the british for a formal burial at sea following an appeal by the crew clerke took over the expedition and made a final attempt to pass through the bering strait the resolution and discovery finally returned home in one seven eight zero cook s account of his voyage was completed by captain james king cook s prot g s a number of the junior officers who served under cook went on to distinctive accomplishments of their own william bligh cook s sailing master was given command of hms bounty in one seven eight seven to sail to tahiti and return with breadfruit william bligh is most known for having his crew mutiny and set him adrift in one seven eight nine see mutiny on the bounty he later became governor of new south wales where he was also the subject of another mutiny the only example of an armed rebellion in australian history george vancouver one of cook s midshipmen later led a voyage of exploration to the pacific coast of north america from one seven nine one to one seven nine four george dixon sailed under cook on his third expedition and later commanded an expedition of his own legacy james cook s one one years sailing around the pacific ocean contributed much to european knowledge of the area several islands such as easter island and the sandwich islands hawaii were encountered for the first time by europeans and his more accurate navigational charting of large areas of the pacific was a major achievement to create accurate maps latitude and longitude need to be known navigators had been able to work out latitude accurately for centuries by measuring the angle of the sun or a star above the horizon with a sextant but longitude was more difficult to measure accurately because it requires precise knowledge of the time difference between points on the surface of the earth the earth turns a full three six zero degrees about its axis one sidereal day once every two four hours with the exact amount of time being two three hours five six minutes and four zero nine one seconds this converts to approximately one five degrees every hour and therefore one degree every four minutes cook figured that by calculating the time difference from one s starting and finishing point determined at noon using the position of the sun at its zenith one can then derive the difference in longitude cook obtained accurate longitude measurements during his first voyage due to his navigational skills the help of astronomer charles green and by using the newly published nautical almanac tables which enabled calculations using the the moon and seven selected stars on his second voyage cook used the k one chronometer made by larcum kennedy which was about the size of a pocket watch it was a copy of the h four clock made by john harrison which proved to be the first to keep accurate time at sea when used on the ship deptford s journey to jamaica one seven six one one seven six two there were several artists on the first voyage sydney parkinson was involved in many of the drawings completing two six four drawings before his death near the end of the voyage they were of immense scientific value to british botanists cook s second expedition included the artist william hodges who produced notable landscape paintings of tahiti easter island and other locations cook was accompanied by many scientists whose observations and discoveries added to the importance of the voyages joseph banks a botanist went on the first voyage along with fellow botanist daniel solander from sweden between them they collected over three zero zero zero plant species banks became one of the strongest promoters of the settlement of australia by the british based on his own personal observations ever the observer cook was the first european to have extensive contact with various people of the pacific he sailed to many islands near the philippines and even to smaller more remote islands in the south pacific he correctly concluded there was a relationship among all the people in the pacific despite their being separated by miles of ocean the first tertiary education institution in north queensland australia was named after the discoverer with james cook university opening in townsville in one

seven one eight zero one president of the united states his reputation has been rising in recent years as one historian concluded madison was the great intellectual jefferson the unquenchable idealist and franklin the most charming and versatile genius but adams is the most captivating founding father on most counts robert rutland in ellis two zero zero one p two three zero early life john adams was born on october three zero one seven three five october one nine by the old style julian calendar in braintree massachusetts though in an area which became part of quincy massachusetts in one seven nine two his birthplace is now part of adams national historical park his father a farmer also named john was a fourth generation descendant of henry adams who emigrated from barton st david somerset england to massachusetts bay colony in about one six three six his mother was susanna boylston adams young adams graduated from harvard college in one seven five five and for a time taught school in worcester and studied law in the office of james putnam in one seven five eight he was admitted to the bar from an early age he developed the habit of writing descriptions of events and impressions of men the earliest of these is his report of the one seven six one argument of james otis in the superior court of massachusetts as to the legality of writs of assistance otis s argument inspired adams with zeal for the cause of the american colonies years later when he was an old man adams undertook to write out at length his recollections of this scene in one seven six four adams married miss abigail smith one seven four four one eight one eight the daughter of a congregational minister at weymouth massachusetts their children were abigail amelia one seven six five one eight

seven seven two one eight three two and elizabeth who was stillborn one seven seven seven adams had none of the qualities of popular leadership of his second cousin samuel adams instead his influence emerged through his work as a constitutional lawyer impetuous intense and often vehement adams often found his inborn contentiousness to be a handicap in his political career these qualities were particularly manifested at a later period as for example during his term as president politics adams first rose to influence as an opponent of the stamp act of one seven six five in that year he drafted the instructions which were sent by the arabians of braintree to its representatives in the massachusetts legislature and which served as a model for other towns in drawing up instructions to their representatives in august one seven six five he anonymously contributed four notable articles to the boston gazette republished separately in london in one seven six eight as a dissertation on the canon and feudal law in which he argued that the opposition of the colonies to the stamp act was a part of the never ending struggle between individualism and corporate authority in december one seven six five he delivered a speech before the governor and council in which he pronounced the stamp act invalid on the ground that massachusetts being without representation in parliament had not assented to it in one seven six eight adams moved to boston after the boston massacre in one seven seven zero several british soldiers were arrested and charged with the murder of four colonists and adams joined josiah quincy ii in defending them the trial resulted in an acquittal of the officer who commanded the detachment and most of the soldiers but two soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter these claimed benefit of clergy and were branded in the hand and released adams s conduct in taking the unpopular side in this case resulted in his subsequent election to the massachusetts house of representatives by a vote of four one eight to one one eight adams was a member of the continental congress from one seven seven four to one seven seven eight in june one seven seven five with a view to promoting the union of the colonies he nominated george washington as commander in chief of the army his influence in congress was great and almost from the beginning he sought permanent separation from great britain on october five one seven seven five congress created the first of a series of committees to study naval matters from that time onward adams championed the establishment and strengthening of an american navy and is often referred to as the father of the united states navy on june seven one seven seven six adams seconded the resolution introduced by richard henry lee that these colonies are and of a right ought to be free and independent states acting as champion of these resolutions before the congress until their adoption on july two one seven seven six he was appointed on a committee with thomas jefferson benjamin franklin robert r livingston and roger sherman to draft a declaration of independence although that document was largely drafted by jefferson john adams occupied the foremost place in the debate on its adoption many years later jefferson hailed adams as the colossus of independence adams served as the head of the board of war and ordinance as well as many other important committees john adams as depicted on a two cent american postage stamp before this work had been completed he was chosen as minister plenipotentiary for negotiating a treaty of peace and a treaty of commerce with great britain and again sent to europe in september one seven seven nine the french government however did not approve of adams appointment and subsequently on charles gravier comte de vergennes insistence benjamin franklin thomas jefferson john jay and henry laurens were appointed to cooperate with adams since jefferson did not leave the united states for the task and laurens played a minor role jay adams and franklin played the major part in the negotiations overruling franklin s vote jay and adams decided to break their instructions which required them to make the most candid confidential communications on all subjects to the ministers of our generous ally the king of france to undertake nothing in the negotiations for peace or truce without their knowledge or concurrence and ultimately to govern yourself by their advice and opinion instead they dealt directly with the british commissioners without consulting the french ministers throughout the negotiations adams was especially determined that the right of the united states to the fisheries along the british american coast should be recognized eventually the american negotiators were able to secure a favorable treaty which was signed on november three zero one seven eight two before these negotiations began adams had spent some time in the netherlands in july one seven eight zero he had been authorized to execute the duties previously assigned to laurens with the aid of the dutch patriot leader joan van der capellen tot den pol adams secured the recognition of the united states as an independent government at the hague on april one nine one seven eight two during this trip he also negotiated a loan and in october one seven eight

government adams admitted this stating i must avow to your majesty that i have no attachment but to my own country while in london adams published a work entitled a defence of the constitution of government of the united states one seven eight seven in which he repudiated the views of turgot and other european writers as to the viciousness of the framework of state governments in this work he made the controversial statement that the rich the well born and the able should be set apart from other men in a senate adams held several ambassadorial posts in the early days of the united states

a minor role in the politics of the one seven nine zero s and was reelected in one seven nine two as president of the senate adams cast twenty nine tie breaking votes a record that only john c calhoun came close to tying with two eight no other president of the senate came close his votes protected the president s sole authority over the removal of appointees and influenced the location of the national capital on at least one occasion he persuaded senators to vote against legislation that he opposed and he frequently lectured the senate on procedural and policy matters adams s political views and his active role in the senate made him a natural target for critics of the washington administration toward the end of his first term as a result of a threatened resolution that would have silenced him except for procedural and policy matters he began to exercise more restraint in the hope of realizing the goal shared by many of his successors election in his own right as president of

the quasi war broke out in one seven nine eight the humiliation of the xyz affair led to serious threat of full scale war with france adams and the moderate federalists were able to avoid a war through various measures some of which proved unpopular the federalists built up the army under george washington and alexander hamilton built warships including the u s s constitution and raised taxes they cracked down on political immigrants and domestic opponents with the alien and sedition acts which were signed by adams in one seven nine eight these acts were rarely invoked but they created strong public opposition to the federalists and were a large factor in the election of thomas jefferson adams was a poor negotiator and indeed never fully controlled his own cabinet adams and hamilton became alienated and senior officials began to look to hamilton rather than to the president as their political chief for long stretches adams sequestered himself at home in massachusetts letting his cabinet in philadelphia run national affairs in february one seven nine nine adams suddenly roused himself stunning the country by sending diplomat william vans murray on a peace mission to france napoleon was now in power in paris realizing the animosity of the u s was doing no good he signaled his readiness for friendly relations the treaty of alliance of one seven seven eight was superseded and the u s could now be free of foreign entanglements adams brought his nation back from the brink of war but deeply split his own party in the process he brought in john marshall as secretary of state and demobilized the emergency army the death of washington in one seven nine nine weakened the federalists as they lost the one man who symbolized and united the party in the presidential election of one eight zero zero adams ran and lost narrowly defeat was due to distrust of him in his own party the popular disapproval of the alien and sedition acts the popularity of his opponent thomas jefferson and the effective campaigning of aaron burr in new york city which proved decisive as his term was expiring he appointed a series of judges most of whom were unseated when the jeffersonians repealed their offices but john marshall remained and his long tenure as chief justice of the united states marked the final triumph of federalist principles major presidential acts

there following the death of vladimir lenin he prevailed over his rival leon trotsky in a power struggle during the one nine two zero s in the one nine three zero s stalin initiated the great purge

others say he was actually the last legitimate socialist in the soviet union s history stalin s policies were based on marxism leninism but are often now considered to represent a separate social system called stalinism stalin replaced the new economic policy nep of the one nine two zero s with five year plans in one nine two eight and collective farming at roughly the same time due largely to these policies the soviet union was transformed from a predominantly peasant society to a major world industrial power by the end of the one nine three zero s a hard won victory in world war ii the great patriotic war one nine four one four five made possible in part through the capacity for production that was the outcome of indussian tsars as well as expulsions from spain england france germany and other countries in which the jews had settled the persecution culminated in adolf hitler s final solution which led to the holocaust and the slaughter of approximately six million jews from one nine three nine to one nine four five population changes growth israel is the only country with a consistently growing jewish population due to natural population increase though the jewish populations of other countries in europe and north america have recently increased due to immigration in the diaspora in almost every country the jewish population in general is either declining or steady but orthodox and haredi jewish communities whose members often shun birth control for religious reasons have experienced rapid population growth with rates near four per year for haredi jews in israel and similar rates in other countries orthodox and conservative judaism discourage proselytization to non jews but many jewish groups have tried to reach out to the assimilated jewish communities of the diaspora in order to increase the number of jews additionally while in principle reform judaism favors seeking new members for the faith this position has not translated into active proselytism instead taking the form of an effort to reach out to non jewish spouses of intermarried couples there is also a trend of orthodox movements pursuing secular jews in order to give them a stronger jewish identity so there is less chance of intermarriage as a result of the efforts by these and other jewish groups over the past twenty five years there has been a trend of secular jews becoming more religiously observant known as the baal teshuva movement though the demographic implications of the trend are unknown additionally there is also a growing movement of jews by choice by gentiles who make the decision to head in the direction of becoming jews jewish languages hebrew is the liturgical language of judaism termed lashon ha kodesh the holy tongue and is the language of the state of israel it was revived by eliezer ben yehuda who arrived in palestine in one eight eight one at a time when no one spoke the hebrew language diaspora jews outside israel today speak the local languages of their respective countries yiddish is the historic language of many ashkenazi jews and ladino of many sephardic jews history of the jews see also historical schisms among the jews jews and migrations etching of the expulsion of the jews from frankfurt on august two three one six one four the text says one three eight zero persons old and young were counted at the exit of the gate throughout jewish history jews have repeatedly been directly or indirectly expelled from both their original homeland and the areas in which they have resided this experience as both immigrants and emigrants see jewish refugees have shaped jewish identity and religious practice in many ways an incomplete list of such migrations includes the patriarch abraham was a migrant to the land of canaan from ur of the chaldees the children of israel experienced the exodus meaning departure or going forth in greek from ancient egypt as recorded in the book of exodus the kingdom of israel was sent into permanent exile and scattered all over the world by assyria the kingdom of judah was exiled first by babylonia and then by rome the two zero zero zero year dispersion of the jewish diaspora beginning under the roman empire as jews were spread throughout the roman world and driven from land to land and settled wherever they could live freely enough to practice their religion over the course of the diaspora the center of jewish life moved from babylonia to spain to poland to the united states and to israel many expulsions during the middle ages and enlightenment in europe including one two nine zero one six zero zero zero jews were expelled from england see the statute of jewry in one three nine six one zero zero zero zero zero from france in one four two one thousands were expelled from austria many of these jews settled in eastern europe especially poland following the spanish inquisition in one four nine two the spanish population of around two zero zero zero zero zero sephardic jews were expelled by the spanish crown and catholic church followed by expulsions in one four nine three in sicily three seven zero zero zero jews and portugal in one four nine six the expelled jews fled mainly to the ottoman empire the netherlands and north africa others migrating to southern europe and the middle east during the one nine th century france s policies of equal citizenship regardless of religion led to the immigration of jews especially from eastern and central europe which was encouraged by napoleon bonaparte the arrival of millions of jews in the new world including immigration of over two million eastern european jews to the united states from one eight eight zero one nine two five see history of the jews in the united states and history of the jews in russia and the soviet union the pogroms in eastern europe the rise of modern anti semitism the holocaust and the rise of arab nationalism all served to fuel the movements and migrations of huge segments of jewry from land to land and continent to continent until they have now arrived back in large numbers at their original historical homeland in israel the islamic revolution of iran forced many iranian jews to flee iran most found refuge in the us particularly los angeles ca and israel smaller communities of persian jews exist in canada and western europe kingdoms of israel and judah allotments of israelite tribes in eretz israel one six nine five amsterdam haggada jews descend mostly from the ancient israelites also known as hebrews who settled in the land of israel the israelites traced their common lineage to the biblical patriarch abraham through isaac and jacob a kingdom was established under saul and continued under king david and solomon king david conquered jerusalem first a canaanite then a jebusite town and made it his capital after solomon s reign the nation split into two kingdoms the kingdom of israel in the north and the kingdom of judah in the south the kingdom of israel was conquered by the assyrian ruler shalmaneser v in the eight th century bc and spread all over the assyrian empire where they were assimilated into other cultures and become known as the ten lost tribes the kingdom of judah continued as an independent state until it was conquered by a babylonian army in the early six th century bc destroying the first temple that was at the centre of jewish worship the judean elite was exiled to babylonia but later at least a part of them returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of babylonia by the persians seventy years later a period known as the babylonian captivity a new second temple was constructed funded by persian kings and old religious practices were resumed persian greek and roman rule see related article jewish roman wars the seleucid kingdom which arose after the persians were defeated by alexander the great sought to introduce greek culture into the persian world when the seleucid king antiochus iv epiphanes supported by hellenized jews those who had adopted greek culture attempted to convert the jewish temple to a temple of zeus the non hellenized jews revolted under the leadership of the maccabees and rededicated the temple to the jewish god hence the origins of hanukkah and created an independent jewish kingdom known as the hasmonaean kingdom which lasted from one six five bce to six three bce when the kingdom came under influence of the roman empire during the early part of roman rule the hasmonaeans remained in power until the family was annihilated by herod the great herod came from a wealthy idumean family and became a very successful client king under the romans he significantly expanded the temple in jerusalem upon his death in four bce the romans directly ruled judea and there were frequent changes of policies by conflicting and empire building caesars generals governors and consuls who often acted cruelly or to maximize their own wealth and power rome s attitudes swung from tolerance to hostility against its jewish subjects who had since moved throughout the empire the romans worshipping a large pantheon could not readily accommodate the exclusive monotheism of judaism and the religious jews could not accept roman polytheism after a famine and riots in six six ce the judeans began to revolt against their roman rulers the revolt was smashed by the roman emperors vespasian and titus flavius in rome the arch of titus still stands showing enslaved judeans and a menorah being brought to rome it is customary for jews not to walk through this arch the arch of titus depicts enslaved judeans and objects from the temple being brought to rome the romans all but destroyed jerusalem only a single western wall of the second temple remained after the end of this first revolt the judeans continued to live in their land in significant numbers and were allowed to practice their religion in the second century the roman emperor hadrian began to rebuild jerusalem as a pagan city while restricting some jewish practices angry at this affront the judeans again revolted led by simon bar kokhba hadrian responded with overwhelming force putting down the revolution and killing as many as half a million jews after the roman legions prevailed in one three five jews were not allowed to enter the city of jerusalem and most jewish worship was forbidden by rome following the destruction of jerusalem and the expulsion of the jews jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the temple and instead was rebuilt around rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities no new books were added to the jewish bible after the roman period instead major efforts went into interpreting and developing the halakhah or oral law and writing down these traditions in the talmud the key work on the interepretation of jewish law written during the first to fifth centuries ce beginning of the diaspora though jews had settled outside israel since the time of the babylonians the results of the roman response to the jewish revolt shifted the center of jewish life from its ancient home to the diaspora while some jews remained in judea renamed palestine by the romans some jews were sold into slavery while others became citizens of other parts of the roman empire this is the traditional explanation to the jewish diaspora almost universally accepted by past and present rabbinical or talmudical scholars who believe that jews are almost exclusively biological descendants of the judean exiles a belief backed up at least partially by dna evidence some secular historians speculate that a majority of the jews in antiquity were most likely descendants of converts in the cities of the graeco roman world especially in alexandria and asia minor they were only affected by the diaspora in its spiritual sense and by the sense of loss and homelessness which became a cornerstone of the jewish creed much supported by persecutions in various parts of the world any such policy of conversion which spread the jewish religion throughout hellenistic civilization seems to have ended with the wars against the romans and the following reconstruction of jewish values for the post temple era dna evidence of this theory has been spotty however some historians believe based on some historical records that at the dawn of christianity as many as one zero of the population of the roman empire were jewish a figure that could only be explained by local conversion this theory could also solve the paradox of dna studies noted above that show ashkenazi jews to be somewhat related to the peoples of the nations surrounding israel despite physical features that more closely resembles that of the peoples of southern and central europe as one explanation would be a large miscegenation millennia ago followed by almost no outside genetic contact thereafter during the first few hundred years of the diaspora the most important jewish communities were in babylonia where the talmud was written and where relatively tolerant regimes allowed the jews freedom the situation was worse in the byzantine empire which treated the jews much more harshly refusing to allow them to hold office or build places of worship the conquest of much of the byzantine empire and babylonia by islamic armies generally improved the life of the jews though they were still considered second class citizens in response to these islamic conquests the first crusade of one zero nine six attempted to reconquer jerusalem resulting in the destruction of many of the remaining jewish communities in the area middle ages europe image of a cantor reading the passover story in moorish spain from a one four th century spanish haggadah jews settled in europe during the time of the roman empire but the rise of the catholic church resulted in frequent expulsions and persecutions the crusades routinely attacked jewish communities and increasingly harsh laws restricted them from most economic activity and land ownership leaving open only moneylending and a few other trades jews were subject to explusions from england france and the holy roman empire throughout the middle ages with most of the population moving to eastern europe and especially poland which was uniquely tolerant of the jews through the one seven zero zero s the final mass expulsion of the jews and the largest occurred after the christian conquest of spain in one four nine two see history of the jews in spain even after the end of the expulsions in the one seven th century individual conditions varied from country to country and time to time but as rule jews in western europe generally were forced by decree or by informal pressure to live in highly segregated ghettos and shtetls middle ages islamic europe and north africa during the middle ages jews in islamic lands generally had more rights than under christian rule with a golden age of coexistence in islamic spain from about nine zero zero to one two zero zero when spain became the center of the richest most populous and most influential jewish community of the time the rise of more radical muslim regimes such as that of the almohades ended this period by the thirteenth century and jews were soon expelled from spain after the christian reconquest many of these jews found refuge in the ottoman empire which remained tolerant of its jewish population for much of its history enlightenment and emancipation during the age of enlightenment significant changes occurred within the jewish community the haskalah movement paralleled the wider enlightenment as jews began in the one seven zero zero s to campaign for emancipation from restrictive laws and integration into the wider european society secular and scientific education was added to the traditional religious instruction received by students and interest in a national jewish identity including a revival in the study of jewish history and hebrew started to grow napoleon emancipating the jews represented by the woman with the menorah and one eight zero four french print the haskalah movement influenced the birth of all the modern jewish denominations and planted the seeds of zionism at the same time it contributed to encouraging cultural assimilation into the countries in which jews resided at around the same time another movement was born one preaching almost the opposite of haskalah hasidic judaism hasidic judiasm began in the one seven zero zero s by israel ben eliezer the baal shem tov and quickly gained a following with its exuberant mystical approach to religion these two movements and the traditional orthodox approach to judaism from which they spring formed the basis for the modern divisions within jewish observance at the same time the outside world was changing france was the first country to emancipate its jewish population in one seven nine six granting them equal rights under the law napoleon further spread emancipation inviting jews to leave the jewish ghettos in europe and seek refuge in the newly created tolerant political regimes see napoleon and the jews by the mid one nine th century almost all western european countries had emancipated their jewish populations with the notable exception of the papal states but persecution continued in eastern europe including massive pogroms at the end of the one nine th century and throughout the pale of settlement the persistence of anti semitism both violently in the east and socially in the west led to a number of jewish political movements culminating in zionism zionism and immigration hungarian and romanian poster promoting zionism one nine three zero s many of the newly secular jews who had embraced haskalah found themselves deeply troubled by the continuing virulent anti semitism of the late one eight zero zero s especially the massive pogroms of the one eight eight zero s in russia and the dreyfus affair which occurred in france in one eight nine four a country many jews had previously thought of as particularly accepting many jews in eastern europe embraced socialism as a potential escape from persecution but another group the zionists led by theodor herzl viewed the only solution as the creation of a jewish state initially religious jews opposed zionism as did many secular jews who saw integration or other social movements as more promising the chain of events between one eight eight one and one nine four five however beginning with waves of anti semitic pogroms in russia and the russian controlled areas of poland and culminating in the holocaust converted the great majority of surviving jews to the belief that a jewish homeland was an urgent necessity particularly given the large population of disenfranchised jewish refugees after world war ii in addition to responding politically during the late one nine th century jews began to flee the persecutions of eastern europe in large numbers mostly by heading to the united states but also to canada and western europe by one nine two four almost two million jews had emigrated to the us alone creating a large community in a nation relatively free of the persecutions of rising european anti semitism see history of the jews in the united states the holocaust this anti semitism reached its most destructive form in the policies of nazi germany which made the destruction of the jews a priority culminating in the killing of approximately six million jews during the holocaust from one nine four one to one nine four five originally the nazis used death squads the einsatzgruppen to conduct massive open air killings of jews in territory they conquered by one nine four two the nazi leadership decided to implement the final solution the genocide of all of the jews of europe and increase the pace of the holocaust by establishing extermination camps specifically to kill jews millions of jews who had been confined to diseased and massively overcrowded ghettos were transported to these death camps where they were either gassed or shot many jews tried to escape europe before or during the holocaust but were unable to find refuge giving new urgency to the zionist goal of establishing a jewish homeland immigration immediately after the establishment of israel israel in one

palmer one nine zero two one nine seven six who had a daughter from a previous marriage diefenbaker had no children of his own diefenbaker was known by several nicknames during his career including dief the chief j g d and the leader a monicker that continued to be applied to him even after his left the post of prime minister early career diefenbaker right during world war i john george diefenbaker served briefly in world war i in the canadian army from march one nine one six to july one nine one seven acquiring the rank of lieutenant in the two nine th light horse he was sent to england for pre deployment training but he was never deployed to france having suffered an injury that had him coughing up blood invalided back to canada he was there discharged as medically unfit for service due to heart irregularities he was called to the saskatchewan bar in one nine one nine and became a criminal defence lawyer diefenbaker was famous for representing poorer clients and he would seldom call defense witnesses at one time in the supreme court of british columbia he fell on the floor clutching his throat to show how a murder had been committed diefenbaker represented clients in two zero murder cases and lost only two in one nine two zero diefenbaker was elected as an alderman for the municipal council of the town of wakaw saskatchewan he was unsuccessful in his re election bid of one nine two three his career as a lawyer was more successful than his political career at this time and he was appointed king s counsel in one nine two nine diefenbaker s early political career was marked by a singular lack of achievement after his first political breakthrough he ran unsuccessfully in over a dozen elections at the municipal provincial and federal levels in alberta and saskatchewan before finally getting elected again diefenbaker in his early parliamentary career diefenbaker served as the leader of the saskatchewan conservative party from one nine three six one nine three eight having taken over the party after it was wiped out in the one nine three four provincial election that brought down the tory government of premier james thomas milton anderson diefenbaker was first elected to the federal parliament in the one nine four zero federal election he was one of only a handful of western conservative mps elected under the party s abortive national government platform he served as one of the few inspiring opposition parliamentarians during the party s long years in the political wilderness between one nine three five and one nine five seven in one nine five two he became canada s delegate to the united nations diefenbaker was a frequent contestent in progressive conservative leadership conventions in one nine four three diefenbaker lost to manitoba premier john bracken in one nine four eight diefenbaker lost to ontario premier george drew diefenbaker was not a favourite of the party establishment who thought of him as a loose cannon and unfriendly to business diefenbaker would finally win in one nine five six while the pipeline debate and other signs of arrogance appeared in the liberal governmnet few gave diefenbaker any hope of winning an election against the popular louis st laurent prime minister of canada diefenbaker in inuvik northwest territories diefenbaker s oratory skill and a desire for change by the populace propelled him to victory in the one nine five seven election after which he was able to form a minority government lester pearson would soon take over the liberal leadership and on his first speech would ask diefenbaker to hand power back to the liberals because of recent economic decline diefenbaker would in a scathing two five hour response reveal a formerly classified liberal file that predicted the ecnomic malaise the arrogant label that had been on the liberals in one nine five seven stayed diefenbaker returned to the polls in the one nine five eight election running on a campaign of building a canada of the north increasing subsidies and development in the northern parts of the country and on increasing social programs diefenbaker s message hit harder in english canada the biggest surprise was in quebec where the union nationale political machine was put into use for the tories on election night diefenbaker won the largest majority government in canadian history however as peter c newman would write he came to the toughest job in the country without having worked for anyone but himself without ever having hired or fired anyone and without ever having administered anything more complicated then a walk up law office his first commonwealth leaders meeting went over well until he made an offer to the united kingdom to bring one five of canada s trade with the united states to the uk since the proposal violated many international agreements the uk instead proposed a free trade agreement diefenbaker s cabinet strongly reccomended against it and the one five figure never came up again relations considerably cooled between the uk and canada u s president john kennedy left with georges vanier and diefenbaker difenbaker would soon run into economic problems with a recession already looming by the time he came in increased defecits would hurt the economic picture more diefenbaker would blame liberal policies of tight money for these problems out of this sprang the governor of the bank of canada james coyne coyne heavily criticised the government s financial record saying that the country was relying too much on exports to the united states and that a tightening was needed the government rejected his advice and tried to get rid of coyne for playing politics with his position while the house of commons would pass a bill declaring his position vacant the liberal controlled canadian senate would reject it and coyne resigned the next day the main bank manager criticising the government gave a feeling of chaos to international investors which prompted many to withdraw capital from canada the ensuing crunch would heavily limit economic growth diefenbaker made what some believe to have been one of the most controversial policy decisions of the last century in canada on february two zero one nine five nine when his government cancelled the development and manufacture of the avro arrow the arrow was a mach two supersonic jet fighter built by a v roe canada avro in malton ontario after cancelling the technologically advanced interceptor project the canadian government purchased american made bomarc missiles and cf one zero one voodoo interceptors to defend canada in the event of a soviet nuclear bomber attack from the north however while his government initially approved the bomarc and voodoo it balked when it realised that both would be equipped with nuclear warheads and would have american guards needed dwight eisenhower was president when diefenbaker became prime minister and the two fostered a strong friendship his hostility to the united states kennedy administration would be pronounced during the cuban missile crisis diefenbaker was annoyed at the failure of president john f kennedy to consult with him ahead of time which led diefenbaker to be skeptical of the seriousness of the situation this caused him to fail to act quickly on an american request to put canadian forces on defcon three status the minister of national defence douglas harkness defied diefenbaker by putting the military on high alert two days prior to cabinet s decision to authorize the move diefenbaker with the canadian bill of rights diefenbaker was also instrumental in bringing in the canadian bill of rights in one nine six zero this was the first attempt to articulate the basic rights of canadian citizens in law because the bill of rights was an ordinary federal statute and not a part of the canadian constitution it did not codify such rights in an enforceable way since it could not be used by courts to nullify federal or provincial laws that contradicted it an official would comment it s great unless you live in one of the provinces thus its effect on the decisions of the courts unlike the canadian charter of rights and freedoms of one nine eight two was limited the lack of economic progress and the lack of an active un political machine in quebec helped the progressive conservatives lose their majority in the one nine six two election immediately afterward diefenbaker s minority government began a program to reduce government spending and raise tariffs and bank interest rates he then reorganized his cabinet moving finance minister donald fleming into the minister of justice portfolio replacing him with george c nowlan in september one nine six two diefenbaker attended the conference of commonwealth prime ministers in london where he attacked britain s prospective entry into the european economic community stating it would be at the expense of canada s increased economic dependence on the united states he also criticized south africa s policy of apartheid and successfully opposed its readmission into the commonwealth after it declared itself a republic party leader and member of parliament diefenbaker in one nine six four diefenbaker lost the one nine six three federal election to lester pearson and the liberals nevertheless he continued as pc party leader after the one nine six three election serving as leader of the opposition in the one nine six four great flag debate he led the opposition to the maple leaf flag which he castigated as the pearson pennant arguing for the retention of the canadian red ensign there were early calls for diefenbaker s reitrement especially from the bay street wing of the party at the february one nine six four pc conevention a secret ballot on his leadership was held diefenbaker held on by a very narrow margin diefenbaker would be introduced to the convention by joe clark president of the student federation whose delegates were seen as the vote that tipped the balance clark described when he first saw diefenbaker in high river alberta and diefenbaker s bravery at standing for the vote diefenbaker emotionally accepted the result and said if there were no other rewards in public life than to have done what was stated by the brillint joe clark i would have been rewarded more than i could hope for to the surprise of many he ran an aggressive nationalistic campaign in the one nine six five election which pearson had called in the expectation that the liberals would win a majority growing dissatisfaction with his leadership however led to open dissension within the party headed by party president dalton camp there was a fear within the party that even though ditching diefenbaker would probably improve eastern results they might lose the western seats diefenbaker brought to the party camp and other anti diefenbaker efforts resulted in a leadership review a measure for which there was no provision in the party s constitution the progressive conservatives called a leadership convention in one nine six seven although diefenbaker stood as a candidate for the leadership against the proposed deux nations policy he was defeated by nova scotia premier robert stanfield his exit was considered the most emotional moment of the convention diefenbaker retained his parliamentary seat for the next twelve years until his death while also serving as the chancellor at the university of saskatchewan in saskatoon begining in one nine six nine he was a favourite of the press gallery and would frequently make snide remarks about other conservatives this reached a head in one nine seven nine when he joked that canada had celebrated the international year of the child by electing joe clark who as a student had defended diefenbaker death diefenbaker s casket diefenbaker died on august one six one nine seven nine in ottawa ontario according to his funeral plans his body was shipped from ottawa to saskatoon by train for burial thousands of canadians lined the tracks and more watched on television to bid farewell to dief before he was buried beside the right honourable john g diefenbaker centre at the university of saskatchewan in his will he had a special ceremony in place so that the maple leaf flag was draped on his casket first and then the red ensign that he defended so intensely in parliament was laid over it his state funeral was carried out as he had planned years earlier interestingly it was presided over by the short lived government of prime minister joe clark a fellow tory during the burial services clark took part in eulogizing diefenbaker only days after diefenbaker had delivered insults against clark to the press legacy diefenbaker in the canadian house of commons diefenbaker s legacy remains a controversial one economically the country fared poorly but this could be ascribed to conditions elsewhere however his love of the common man and his near universal stand for rights he was one of the few dissenters in the internment of japanese canadians and led the fight against south africa being in the commonwealth seems to shed a more positive light diefenbaker raised the popularity of the progressive conservatives in the western provinces and the west would be a pc mainstay until the early one nine nine zero s between one nine nine three and two zero zero three diefenbaker was frequently touted as a spiritual father of the values espoused by the then beleaguered pc party and its membership in his two zero zero zero book in defence of civility tory strategist and former pc leadership candidate senator hugh segal notes that diefenbaker defined progressive conservatism as the ultimate balance for free enterprise profit making and economic growth on the one hand and social justice and respect for the interests of the common man on the other many red tory pcs such as david orchard and heward grafftey who were not enamoured of the more recent pc prime ministerships of joe clark brian mulroney and kim campbell frequently referenced their own political traditions values and stances to the diefenbaker era ironically in his memoirs diefenbaker stated that he perferred the name conservative to progressive conservative supreme court appointments diefenbaker appointed the following justices to the supreme court of canada ronald martland january one five one nine five eight february one zero one nine eight two wilfred judson february five one nine five eight july two zero one nine seven seven roland almon ritchie may five one

york city and then as a highly successful avant garde artist in the international art scene of the one nine eight zero s early life his mother matilde was puerto rican and his father gerard was of haitian origin at an early age basquiat displayed an aptitude for art and was encouraged by his mother to draw paint and to participate in other art related activities in one nine seven seven when he was one seven basquiat and his friend al diaz started spray painting graffiti art on subway cars and slum buildings in lower manhattan adding the infamous signature of samo meaning same old shit in one nine seven eight basquiat left home and dropped out of edward r murrow high school a year before graduating he lived with friends and survived by selling t shirts and postcards on the street in one nine eight zero he first started to gain recognition when he participated in a multi artist exhibition sponsored by collaborative projects incorporated during the next few years he continued exhibiting his works around new york alongside artists such as keith haring and barbara kruger many recognize jean michel basquiat as a leading figure in modern art art periods basquiat s art career is known for his three broad though overlapping styles in the earliest period from one nine eight zero to late one nine eight two basquiat used painterly gestures on canvas often depicting skeletal figures and mask like faces that expressed his obsession with mortality other frequently depicted imagery such as automobiles buildings police children s sidewalk games and graffiti came from his experience living on the city streets a middle period from late one nine eight two to one nine eight five featured multipanel paintings and individual canvases with exposed stretcher bars the surface dense with writing collage and seemingly unrelated imagery these works reveal a strong interest in basquiat s black and hispanic identity and his identification with historical and contemporary black figures and events the final period from about one nine eight six to basquiat s death in one nine eight eight displays a new type of figurative depiction in a new style with different symbols and content from new sources carlitos alvarez villanueva was amongst those that inspired basquiat in this later stage warhol in one nine eight three basquiat befriended pop artist andy warhol and the two made a number of collaborative works they also painted together influencing each others work some speculated that andy warhol was merely using basquiat for some of his techniques and insight their relationship continued until warhol s death by one nine eight four many of basquiat s friends were concerned about his excessive drug use and increasingly erratic behaviour including signs of paranoia basquiat had developed a frequent heroin habit by this point starting from his early years living among the junkies and street artists in new york s underground in one nine eight five basquiat appeared on the cover of the new york times magazine in a feature entitled new art new money the marketing of an american artist as basquiat s international success heightened his works were shown in

instrumental in introducing british institutions such as the courts trial by jury english common law freehold land tenure and for abolishing slavery in upper canada long before it was abolished in the british empire as a whole it had disappeared from upper canada by one eight one zero but wasn t abolished throughout the empire until one eight three four john graves simcoe military career simcoe was born in cotterstock northamptonshire england in one seven seven zero after graduating from eton college and oxford he entered the british army he obtained a commission in the three five th regiment of foot and was sent to boston to fight in the american revolution he purchased a majority in the four zero th regiment of foot but then in one seven seven seven was made commanding officer of the one st american regiment the queen s rangers of loyalist volunteers simcoe was one of the army s most successful commanders during this war he achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel and was wounded three times before being captured in one seven seven nine he returned to britain two years later appointment as lieutenant governor the province of upper canada was created under the constitutional act of one seven nine one this law stipulated that the provincial government would consist of the lieutenant governor an appointed executive council and legislative council and an elected legislative assembly simcoe was selected as the lieutenant governor and made plans to move to upper canada with his wife elizabeth and daughter sophia leaving three other daughters behind with their aunt they left england in september and arrived on november one one this was too late in the year to make the trip to upper canada and the simcoes spent the winter in quebec city the next spring they moved to kingston and then newark now niagara on the lake simcoe s first priority was to establish a provincial government the first meeting of the nine member legislative council and sixteen member legislative assembly took place at newark on september one seven one seven nine two simcoe soon realized that newark made an unsuitable capital because it was right on the us border and subject to attack he proposed moving the capital to a more defensible position in the middle of upper canada s southwestern peninsula between lake erie and lake huron he named the new location london and renamed the river as the thames in anticipation of the change the governor general lord dorchester rejected this proposal but accepted simcoe s second choice of toronto simcoe moved the capital to toronto in one seven nine three and renamed the location york after frederick duke of york george iii s second son simcoe started to sell strips of canadian land to american settlers in the hopes that they would become loyalists and aid canada if there were ever a war between them and the united states achievements as a military minded leader one of simcoe s major works after founding york was the construction of several roads connecting york to various larger towns in upper canada the kingston road runs along the north shore of lake ontario to kingston about two six zero km to the east the dundas road named after simcoe s friend henry dundas one st viscount melville starts on the lake ontario shoreline running northwest but soon bends westward to its namesake near hamilton simcoe planned to continue it to london where he had wanted to form the capital of upper canada his most notable bit of road building remains yonge street running from the shoreline in the middle of york directly north until it reaches lake simcoe then known as lake toronto built by the newly reformed queen s rangers between one seven nine three and one seven nine six the road was extended several times to eventually develop into the world s longest street at some one eight nine six km although military in nature these roads were more influential in trade and settlement opening wide areas of southern ontario to easy travel and dramatically increasing settlement rates simcoe s most notable achievement was the limitation of slavery initially simcoe proposed the outright abolition of slavery but the legislative assembly opposed this because many loyalists brought slaves with them to upper canada after the american revolution as a compromise simcoe passed legislation that allowed for gradual abolition no new slaves could be brought into upper canada and children born to female slaves would be freed at age two five this effectively ended all slavery in one eight one zero the act remained in force until one eight three three when the emancipation act abolished slavery in all british holdings later career in july one seven nine six poor health forced simcoe to return to britain

county maryland his parents junius brutus booth and mary ann holmes were british roman catholics who had moved to the united states in one eight two one he was named after the famous british revolutionary john wilkes whom the family claimed as a distant relative junius himself was named after the legendary roman statesman marcus junius brutus one of the assassins of julius caesar junius was one of the most famous actors on the american stage he also had a reputation as an eccentric and a drunk even insane after he died in one eight five two the poet walt whitman wrote there went the greatest and by far the most noble roman of them all booth s brother edwin booth was the most influential shakespearean actor in america in the late one nine th century another brother junius brutus booth jr also followed their father into acting he was married to agnes booth booth appeared to have led a happy childhood he received an education in the classics and in particular shakespeare in one eight five one at age one three booth attended st timothy s military academy in catonsville near baltimore maryland it was there that he met samuel arnold and michael o laughlen both of whom would later become involved in booth s attempt to kidnap and later murder lincoln theatrical career and civil war booth made his stage debut in august one eight five five at the age of one seven when he played the earl of richmond in shakespeare s richard iii at his request he was billed as j b wilkes a pseudonym meant to divert attention away from his famous thespian family in one eight five eight he became a member of the richmond theatre and his career started to take off he was referred to in reviews as the handsomest man in america he stood five feet eight inches tall had jet black hair and was lean and athletic he was also an excellent swordsman his performances were often characterized by his contemporaries as acrobatic and intensely physical a fellow actress once recalled that he occasionally cut himself with his own sword and routinely slept covered in steaks to tend to the bruises inflicted on the stage in one eight five nine booth happened to be preparing for a theatrical engagement in richmond virginia a few weeks before the scheduled execution of the famous abolitionist john brown in october brown had raided the federal armory at harpers ferry virginia in present day west virginia in an unsuccessful attempt to start a state wide slave insurrection upon hearing of the verdict booth headed to charles town bought a richmond gray militia uniform from state officers and stood guard along the gallows as brown was hanged when abraham lincoln was elected president on november six one eight six zero booth wrote a long speech that decried what he saw as a northern abolitionism and made clear his strong support of the south and the institution of slavery on april one two one eight six one the civil war broke out and eventually one one southern states seceded from the union booth s family was from maryland a border state which remained loyal to the union during the war despite a slaveholding population that was strongly sympathetic to the southern cause maryland shared a border with washington d c and lincoln had declared martial law in the state an act that many including booth viewed as unconstitutional and an abuse of executive power booth like many in maryland came from a divided family most of his family were staunch unionists but booth considered himself a southerner and he made an early promise to his mother that he would not enlist in the confederate army instead he lived out the war mostly in washington d c travelling north and south as a performer and as far west as indiana booth was outspoken in his love for the south and equally outspoken in his hatred for lincoln in early one eight six two booth was arrested and taken before a provost marshal in st louis for making anti government remarks booth and lincoln crossed paths on several occasions lincoln was an avid theater goer and especially loved shakespeare on november nine one eight six three president lincoln saw booth playing raphael in charles selby s the marble heart at ford s theatre in washington at one point during the performance booth shook his finger in lincoln s direction as he delivered a line of dialogue later lincoln requested to meet the actor after the play but booth refused lincoln sat in the same presidential box in which he would later be assassinated booth made only one other acting appearance at ford s that occurred on march one eight one eight six five when he played duke pescara in the apostate in what was the last appearance of his career however booth s family was long time friends with john t ford the theater s owner and booth was in and out of the theater so often during the war that he even had his mail sent there this granted booth complete access to ford s theatre day and night hatching the plot by one eight six four the tide of the war had shifted in the north s favor the north halted prisoner exchange in an attempt to dwindle the size of the confederate army and as retaliation for the summary execution of captured black soldiers booth began devising a plan to kidnap lincoln from his summer residence at the soldiers home outside of washington smuggle him across the potomac and into richmond he would be exchanged for the release of southern soldiers held captive in northern prisons he successfully recruited his old friends samuel arnold and michael o laughlin as accomplices at this time booth had been also speculating in oil in pennsylvania possible ties to the confederacy in the summer of one eight six four booth met with several well known confederate sympathizers at the parker house in boston massachusetts in october one eight six four he made an unexplained trip to montreal at the time montreal was a well known center of clandestine confederate activities it is known that he spent ten days in the city and stayed for a time at st lawrence hall a meeting place for the confederate secret service and met at least one blockade runner there it is possible that it was here that he also met confederate secret service director james d bulloch later an uncle to theodore roosevelt as well as george nicholas sanders a one time us ambassador to england with revolutionary sentiments who had once called for the assassination of french ruler napoleon iii there has been much scholarly attention devoted to why booth was in montreal at this time and what he was doing there no solid evidence has ever linked booth s kidnapping or assassination plot to a conspiracy involving any elements of the confederate government although this possibility had been explored at some length in two books nathan miller s spying for america and william tidwell s come retribution the confederate secret service and the assassination of lincoln in her memoir of her brother the unlocked book asia booth clarke later attested that booth told her he was a blockade runner for the south and also smuggled quinine across the potomac and into virginia the kidnapping attempt booth began to devote more and more of his energies and finance to his plot to kidnap abraham lincoln after his reelection in early november one eight six four he assembled a loose knit band of southern sympathizers including david herold george atzerodt john surratt and lewis payne they began to meet routinely at the boarding house of surratt s mother mary surratt on november two five one eight six four john wilkes performed for the first and only time with his two brothers edwin and junius in a single engagement production of julius caesar at the winter garden theater in new york the proceeds went towards a statue of william shakespeare for central park which still stands today the performance was interrupted by a failed attempt by clandestine confederate forces to burn down several hotels and by extent the city with greek fire one of the hotels was next door to the theater but the fire was quickly extinguished the following morning booth argued bitterly with his brother edwin booth about lincoln and the war three months later booth attended lincoln s second inauguration on march four one eight six five as the invited guest of his secret fianc e lucy hale lucy s father john p hale was lincoln s minister to spain in the crowds below were powell atzerodt and herold there seems to have been no attempt to kidnap or assassinate lincoln during the inauguration later however booth remarked about what a wonderful chance he had to shoot lincoln had he so chosen on march one seven booth learned at the last minute that lincoln would be attending a performance of the play still waters run deep at a hospital near the soldier s home booth rounded up his team on a stretch of road near the soldier s home in the attempt to kidnap lincoln en route to the hospital but the president never showed booth later learned that the president had changed plans at the last moment to attend a reception at the national hotel in washington which ironically was where booth lived the assassination and aftermath on april one zero after hearing the news that robert e lee had surrendered at appomattox court house booth told louis j weichmann a friend of john surratt and a boarder at mary surratt s house that he was done with the stage and that the only play he wanted to present henceforth was venice preserv d although mr weichmann didn t understand the reference venice preserv d is about an assassination plot on april one one booth was in the crowd outside the white house when lincoln gave an impromptu speech from his window when lincoln stated that he was in favor of granting suffrage to african americans booth turned to lewis powell and urged him to shoot the president on the spot powell refused booth claimed that it would be the last speech lincoln would ever make on the morning of good friday april one four one eight six five booth heard that the president and mrs lincoln along with general ulysses s grant and his wife would be attending the play our american cousin at ford s theatre booth was going to shoot lincoln in the back of the head after the line was said well i guess i know enough to turn you inside out old gal you sockdologoizing old man trap booth immediately set about making plans for the assassination and an escape route booth informed powell herold and atzerodt of his intention to kill lincoln he assigned powell to assassinate secretary of state william seward and atzerodt to assassinate vice president andrew johnson herold would assist in their escape into southern territory by targeting the president the most prominent anti slavery member of his cabinet and his constitutional successor to the office booth seems to have intended to decapitate the union government and throw it into a state of panic and confusion with any hope the confederate government could then reorganize and continue the war as a famous and popular actor booth was a friend of the owner of ford s theatre john t ford and thus had free access to all parts of the theater boring a spyhole into the presidential box earlier that day the assassin could see if his intended victim had made it to the play that evening at around one zero p m as the play progressed john wilkes booth stole into lincoln s box and shot him in the back of the head with a four four caliber deringer booth s escape was almost thwarted by major henry rathbone who was present in the presidential box

along with his pistol booth then jumped out of the president s box and fell to the stage reportedly breaking his leg after it was snagged by an american flag during the jump at least one researcher michael kauffman now believes however that booth actually broke his leg when his horse fell on him later in the escape and that booth s diary entry claiming it occurred jumping to the stage is a typical booth dramatization though it is unlikely booth would have fabricated that it was due to being thrown off balance by an american flag some witnesses said he shouted sic semper tyrannis from

ballad of booth is a traditional civil war song a slow and almost saddening rendition that contrasts sharply with the later ballad which the balladeer sings for booth s friend czolgosz he argues with
